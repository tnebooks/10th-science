**Introduction**

Plants exhibits varying degrees of organization. Atoms are organized into molecules, molecules into organelles, organelles into cells, cells into tissues and tissues into organs. The first account of internal structure of plants was published by English Physician **Nehemiah Grew**. He is known as **Father of Plant Anatomy**. Plant anatomy (Gk _Ana_ = as under; _Temnein_ = to cut) is the study of internal structure of plants. You have already studied the different kinds of tissues in standard IX. In this lesson, you will study about the internal structure of plant tissues, process of photosynthesis and respiration.

## Tissues


Tissues are the group of cells that are similar or dissimilar in structure and origin, but perform similar function. Plant tissues

can be broadly classified into two, based on their ability to divide. They are

i) Meristamatic tissue ii) Permanent tissue.

## Tissue system


Sachs (1875) classified tissue system in plants into three types

i) Dermal or Epidermal tissue system ii) Ground tissue system iii) Vascular tissue system

The functions of these tissues are given in Table 12.1.

### Dermal or Epidermal Tissue System


It consists of epidermis, stomata and epidermal outgrowths. Epidermis is the outer most layer. It has many minute pores called stomata.

**Learning Objectives**

At the end of this lesson the students will be able to: ‹‹ Understand vascular tissue system- their types and functions. ‹‹ Know the structure of dicot root, stem, leaf and monocot root, stem, leaf. ‹‹ Differentiate the internal structure of dicot root, stem, leaf with that of monocot root,

stem, leaf. ‹‹ Name the different pigments found in chloroplast. ‹‹ Elaborate on the structure and functions of plastids. ‹‹ Enumerate the steps involved in photosynthesis. ‹‹ Understand the structure of mitochondria ‹‹ List the basic events of aerobic and anerobic respiration.

Cuticle is present on the outer wall of epidermis to check evaporation of water. Trichomes and root hairs are the epidermal outgrowths.

**Functions:** i) Epidermis protects the inner tissues. ii) Stomata helps in transpiration. iii) Root hairs help in absorption of water and

minerals.

### Ground Tissue System


It includes all the tissues of the plant body except epidermal and vascular tissues like (i) Cortex (ii) Endodermis (iii) Pericycle (iv) Pith

### Vascular Tissue System


It consists of xylem and phloem tissues. They are present in the form of bundles called vascular bundles. Xylem conducts water and minerals to different parts of the plant. Phloem conducts food materials to different parts of the plant.

There are three different types of vascular bundles namely (i) Radial (ii) Conjoint (iii) Concentric **(i) Radial Bundles**

Xylem and phloem are present in different radii alternating with each other. e.g. roots

**(ii) Conjoint bundles** Xylem and phloem lie on the same radius.

There are two types of conjoint bundles.

**a) Collateral** Xylem lies towards the centre and phloem

lies towards the periphery. When cambium is present in collateral

bundles, it is called open. e.g. dicot stem and collateral bundle without cambium is called closed. e.g. monocot stem.

**b) Bicollateral** In this type of bundle, the phloem is

present on both outer and inner side of xylem. e.g. _Cucurbita_

**(iii) Concentric Bundles** Vascular bundle in which xylem completely

surrounds the phloem or viceversa is called concentric vascular bundle. It is of two types:

1\. **Amphivasal:** Xylem surrounds phloem. e.g. _Dracaena_

2\. **Amphicribral:** Phloem surrounds xylem. e.g. Ferns

**Endarch:** Protoxylem lies towards the centre and metaxylem lies towards the periphery. e.g. stem.

**Exarch :** Protoxylem lies towards the periphery and metaxylem lies towards the centre. e.g. roots.

## Internal Structure of Dicot Root (Bean)


A thin transverse section of dicot root shows the following structures.

**(i) Epiblema:** It is the outermost layer. Cuticle and stomata are absent. Unicellular root hairs are present. It is also known as **Rhizodermis** or **Piliferous layer**.

**(ii) Cortex:** It is a multilayered large zone made of thin-walled parenchymatous cells with intercellular spaces. It stores food and water.

**(iii) Endodermis:** It is the innermost layer of cortex. The cells are barrel - shaped, closely packed, and show band like thickenings on their radial and inner tangential walls called **casparian strips**. But these casparian strips are absent in the endodermis cells which are located opposite the protoxylem these thin walled cells without casparian strips are called passage cell. It helps in the movement of water and dissolved salts from cortex into xylem.

### Functions of Chloroplast


1\. Photosynthesis 2. Storage of starch 3. Synthesis of fatty acids 4. Storage of lipids 5. Formation of chloroplasts

### Photosynthesis


Photosynthesis (Photo = light; synthesis = to build) is a process by which autotrophic organisms like green plants, algae and chlorophyll containing bacteria utilize the energy from sunlight to synthesize their own food. In this process, carbon dioxide combines with water in the presence of sunlight and chlorophyll to form carbohydrates. During this process oxygen is released as a byproduct.

6CO + 12HO + 6 HO chlorophyll

Light  C6H12O6 + 6O↑

Carbon dioxide + Water  Glucose + Oxygen+ Water

### Where does photosynthesis occur?


Photosynthesis occurs in all green parts of the plant especially in green leaves.

### Photosynthetic Pigments


Pigments involved in photosynthesis are called **Photosynthetic pigments.** Photosynthetic pigments are of two classes namely, the primary pigments and accessory pigments. Chlorophyll a is the **primary pigment** that traps solar energy and converts it into electrical and chemical energy. Thus it is called the reaction centre. Other pigments such as chlorophyll b and carotenoids are called **accessory pigments** as they pass on the absorbed energy to chlorophyll a (Chl.a) molecule. Reaction centre (Primary pigments) and harvesting centre (Accessary pigments) together form Pigment systems.

### Role of Sunlight in Photosynthesis


The entire process of photosynthesis takes place inside the chloroplast. The structure of chloroplast is such that the light dependent (**Light reaction**) and light independent (**Dark reaction) take place at different sites in the** organelle

**1\. Light dependent Reaction (Hill reaction \\ Light reaction)** This was discovered by Robin Hill (1939).

This reaction takes place in the presence of light energy in **thylakoid membranes** (grana) of the chloroplasts. Photosynthetic pigments absorb the light energy and convert it into chemical energy ATP and NADPH2. These products of light reaction move out from the thylakoid to the stroma of the chloroplast.

**More to Know**

ATP Adenosine Triphosphate

ADP Adenosine Diphosphate

NAD Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide

NADP Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate

A cell cannot get its energy directly from glucose. So in respiration the energy

released from glucose is used to make ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate)

**2\. Light independent reactions (Dark reaction) (Biosynthetic phase)**

Dark reaction or biosynthetic pathway is takes place in **stroma**. During this reaction CO2 is reduced into carbohydrates with the help of light generated ATP and NADPH2. This is also called as **Calvin cycle** and is carried out in the absence of light. It is called dark reaction.

182**10th Standard Science**

In Calvin cycle the inputs are CO2 from the atmosphere and the ATP and NADPH2 produced from light reaction.

**Figure 12.9** Overview of Hill and Calvin cycle

Melvin Calvin, an American biochemist, discovered chemical pathway for photosynthesis. The cycle is named as Calvin cycle. He was awarded with Nobel

Prize in the year 1961 for his discovery.

### Factors Affecting Photosynthesis


**a) Internal Factors**: i) Pigments ii) Leaf age iii) Accumulation of carbohydrates iv) Hormones

**b) External Factors**: i) Light ii) Carbon dioxide iii) Temperature iv) Water v) Mineral elements

**Info bit**

Artificial photosynthesis is a method for producing renewable energy by the use of sunlight. Indian scientist C.N.R. Rao who was conferred the Bharat Ratna (2013) is also working on similar technology of artificial photosynthesis to produce - Hydrogen fuel (renewable energy).

## Mitochondria


Mitochondria are filamentous or granular cytoplasmic organelles present in cells. The mitochondria were first discovered by Kolliker in 1857 as granular structures in striated muscles. Mitochondria (singular: mitochondrion) are organelles within eukaryotic cells that produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) which form the energy currency of the cell, for this reason, the mitochondria is referred to as the “**Power house of the cell**”. Mitochondria vary in size from 0.5 µm to 2.0 µm. Mitochondria contain 60-70% protein, 25-30% lipids, 5-7% RNA and small amount of DNA and minerals.

### Structure of Mitochondria Mitochondrial Membranes:
 It consists

two membranes called inner and outer membrane. Each membrane is 60-70 Å thick. Outer mitochondrial membrane is smooth and freely permeable to most small molecules. It contains enzymes, proteins and lipids. It has **porin molecules** (proteins) which form channels for passage of molecules through it.

**Figure 12.10** Structure of Mitochondria

Oxysome

Inner mitochondrial membrane is semi permeable membrane and regulates the passage of materials into and out of the mitochondria. It is rich in enzymes and carrier proteins. It consists of 80% proteins and lipids.

183 **Plant Anatomy and Plant Physiology**

**Cristae: The inner mitochondrial**

membrane gives rise to finger like projections

called cristae. These cristae increase the inner

surface area (fold in inner membrane) of the

mitochondria to hold variety of enzymes.

**Oxysomes: The inner mitochondrial**

membrane bear minute regularly spaced tennis

racket shaped particles known as oxysomes

(F1 particle). They involve in ATP synthesis.

### Functions of Mitochondria


• Mitochondria is the main organelle of cell respiration. They produce a large number of ATP molecules. So they are called as **power houses** **of the cell** or **ATP factory of the cell**.

• It helps the cells to maintain normal concentration of calcium ions.

• It regulates the metabolic activity of the cell.

## TYPES OF RESPIRATION


Respiration involves exchange of gases between the organism and the external environment. The plants obtain oxygen from

their environment and release carbon dioxide and water vapour. This exchange of gases is known as **external respiration**. It is a physical process. Biochemical process occurs within cells where the food is oxidized to obtain energy, this is known as cellular respiration

### Aerobic respiration


Aerobic respiration is the type of celluar respiration in which organic food is completely oxidized with the help of oxygen into carbon dioxide, water and energy. It occurs in most plants and animals.

C6H12O6 + 6O**2** → 6CO2 + 6H2O + ATP

**Stages of Aerobic respiration**

**a. Glycolysis** (Glucose splitting): It is the breakdown of one molecule of glucose (6 carbon) into two molecules of pyruvic acid (3 carbon). Glycolysis takes place in cytoplasm of the cell. It is the first step of both aerobic and anerobic respiration.

**b. Krebs Cycle: This cycle occurs in** mitochondria matrix. At the end of glycolysis, 2 molecules of pyruvic acid enter into mitochondria. The oxidation of pyruvic acid into CO2 and water takes place through this cycle. It is also called **Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle** (TCA).

**c. Electron Transport Chain: This is** accomplished through a system of electron carrier complex called **electron transport chain** (ETC) located on the inner membrane of the mitochondria. NADH2 and FADH2 molecules formed during glycolysis and Krebs cycle are oxidised to NAD+ and FAD+ to release the energy via electrons. The electrons, as they move through the system, release energy which is trapped by ADP to synthesize ATP. This is called **oxidative phosphorylation**. In this

10th\_Science\_Unit-12.indd 183 06-12-2021 18:39:23

www.tntextbooks.in




  

184**10th Standard Science**

process, O2 the ultimate acceptor of electrons gets reduced to water.

### Anaerobic respiration


Anaerobic respiration takes place without oxygen. Glucose is converted into ethanol (Ethanol fermentation by yeast) or lactic acid (lactic acid fermentation by bacteria).

C6H12O6 → 2CO2 + 2C2H5OH + Energy (ATP)

### Respiratory quotient (R.Q)


Respiratory quotient is the ratio of volume of carbon dioxide liberated and the volume of oxygen consumed during respiration. It is expressed as

RQ = Volume of CO2 liberated Volume of O2 consumed

**Points to Remember**

‹™ Tissue is a group of similar or dissimilar cells, having a common orgin and performing similar functions. ‹™ Plants are capable of synthesizing glucose

from CO2 and H2O in the presence of light, by the process of photosynthesis. ‹™ Light reaction takes place in grana of

chloroplast. ‹™ Dark reaction takes place in stroma of

chloroplast. ‹™ Respiration involves both external and

cellular respiration. ‹™ Aerobic respiration takes place in the

presence of oxygen. ‹™ Aerobic respiration occurs in three major

steps like Glycolysis, Krebs cycle and Electron transport chain.

**V. Answer in a sentence** 1\. What is collateral vascular bundle? 2. Where does the carbon that is used in

photosynthesis come from? 3. What is the common step in aerobic and

anaerobic pathway? 4. Name the phenomenon by which

carbohydrates are oxidized to release ethyl alcohol.

**VI. Short answer questions** 1\. Give an account on vascular bundle of

dicot stem. 2. Write a short note on mesophyll**.** 3\. Draw and label the structure of oxysomes. 4. Name the three basic tissues system in

flowering plants. 5. What is photosynthesis and where in a

cell does it occur?

6\. What is respiratory quotient? 7. Why should the light dependent reaction

occur before the light independent reaction? 8. Write the reaction for photosynthesis?

**VII. Long answer questions** 1\. Differentiate the following a) Monocot root and Dicot root b) Aerobic and Anaerobic respiration 2. Describe and name three stages of cellular

respiration that aerobic organisms use to obtain energy from glucose.

3\. How does the light dependent reaction differ from the light independent reaction? What are the end product and reactants in each? Where does each reaction occur within the chloroplast?

**VIII. Higher Order Thinking Skills(HOTS)** 1\. The reactions of photosynthesis make up a

biochemical pathway. A) What are the end product of light and

dark reaction of photosynthesis? B) Explain how the biochemical pathway

of photosynthesis recycles many of its own reactions and identify the recycled reactants.

2\. Where do the light dependent reaction and the Calvin cycle occur in the chloroplast?
