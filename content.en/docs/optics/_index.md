## 2.1 PROPERTIES OF LIGHT

1. Light is a form of energy
2. Light always travels along a straight line
3. Light does not need any medium for its propagation. It can even travel through vacuum
4. The speed of light in vacuum or air is, **c = 3 × 10⁸ m/s**
5. Since light is in the form of waves, it is characterized by a wavelength (λ) and frequency (ν), related by: **c = νλ**
6. Different coloured light has different wavelength and frequency
7. Among visible light, violet light has the lowest wavelength and red light has the highest wavelength
8. When light is incident on the interface between two media, it is partly reflected and partly refracted

---

## 2.2 REFRACTION OF LIGHT

When a ray of light travels from one transparent medium into another obliquely, the path of the light undergoes deviation. This deviation is called **refraction**.

### 2.2.1 First Law of Refraction
The incident ray, the refracted ray of light and the normal to the refracting surface all lie in the same plane.

### 2.2.2 Second Law of Refraction (Snell's Law)
$$\frac{\sin i}{\sin r} = \frac{\mu_2}{\mu_1}$$

**Refractive index** is defined as:
$$\mu = \frac{c}{v}$$

- When light travels from denser to rarer medium: refracted ray bends **away** from normal
- When light travels from rarer to denser medium: refracted ray bends **towards** normal

---

## 2.3 DISPERSION OF LIGHT

When white light is refracted through a transparent medium (glass/water), it splits into component colours. This phenomenon is called **dispersion of light**.

**Spectrum (VIBGYOR):** Violet, Indigo, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, Red

- Different colours bend through different angles
- Angle of refraction is smallest for **red** and highest for **violet**
- Refractive index depends on wavelength of light

---

## 2.4 SCATTERING OF LIGHT

When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, atoms and molecules of gases refract light in all possible directions.

### 2.4.1 Types of Scattering

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Elastic scattering** | Energy of incident and scattered beam are same |
| **Inelastic scattering** | Energy of incident and scattered beam are different |

#### Rayleigh Scattering
- Scattering by atoms/molecules of gases
- **Rayleigh's Law:** Amount of scattering ∝ 1/λ⁴
- Shorter wavelengths scatter more → sky appears blue
- At sunrise/sunset: blue scatters away, red reaches us

#### Mie Scattering
- Occurs when scatterer diameter ≥ wavelength
- Amount of scattering is **independent** of wavelength
- Caused by pollen, dust, smoke, water droplets
- Responsible for white appearance of clouds

#### Tyndall Scattering
- Scattering by colloidal particles
- Example: Dust particles in a room making light beam visible

#### Raman Scattering
- Change in wavelength/frequency occurs
- **Stokes lines:** frequency lower than incident
- **Anti-stokes lines:** frequency higher than incident

## 2.5 LENSES

A lens is an optically transparent medium bounded by two spherical refracting surfaces or one plane and one spherical surface.

### Types of Lenses

**Converging Lenses (Convex):**
- Thicker at centre than at edges
- Converges parallel beam to a point
- Types: Biconvex, Plano-convex, Positive meniscus

**Diverging Lenses (Concave):**
- Thinner at centre than at edges
- Diverges parallel beam
- Types: Biconcave, Plano-concave, Negative meniscus

---

## 2.6 RULES FOR IMAGE FORMATION

**Rule 1:** Ray through optical centre passes undeviated

**Rule 2:** Ray parallel to principal axis, after refraction:
- Convex lens: passes through focus
- Concave lens: appears to diverge from focus

**Rule 3:** Ray passing through focus (convex) or directed towards focus (concave), after refraction travels parallel to principal axis

## 2.7 IMAGES BY CONVEX LENS

| Object Position | Image Position | Nature | Size |
|-----------------|----------------|--------|------|
| At infinity | At F | Real, inverted | Point-sized |
| Beyond C (2F) | Between F and C | Real, inverted | Diminished |
| At C (2F) | At C (2F) | Real, inverted | Same size |
| Between F and C | Beyond C | Real, inverted | Magnified |
| At F | At infinity | Real, inverted | Highly magnified |
| Between F and O | Same side as object | Virtual, erect | Magnified |

### Applications of Convex Lenses
1. Camera lenses
2. Magnifying lenses
3. Microscopes, telescopes, slide projectors
4. Correcting hypermetropia

## 2.9 IMAGES BY CONCAVE LENS

| Object Position | Image Position | Nature | Size |
|-----------------|----------------|--------|------|
| At infinity | At focus (F₁) | Virtual, erect | Point-sized |
| At finite distance | Between O and F₁ | Virtual, erect | Diminished |

*As object distance decreases, image distance decreases and image size increases*

### Applications of Concave Lenses
1. Eye lens of Galilean telescope
2. Wide angle spy holes in doors
3. Correcting myopia

---

## 2.11 LENS FORMULA

$$\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{v} - \frac{1}{u}$$

Applicable to both convex and concave lenses.

## 2.12 SIGN CONVENTION (Cartesian)

1. Object always placed on left side of lens
2. All distances measured from optical centre
3. Distances in direction of incident light: **positive**
4. Distances against direction of incident light: **negative**
5. Distances upward perpendicular to axis: **positive**
6. Distances downward perpendicular to axis: **negative**

## 2.13 MAGNIFICATION

$$m = \frac{h'}{h} = \frac{v}{u}$$

- m > 1: enlarged image
- m < 1: diminished image

## 2.14 LENS MAKER'S FORMULA

$$\frac{1}{f} = (\mu - 1)\left(\frac{1}{R_1} - \frac{1}{R_2}\right)$$

## 2.15 POWER OF A LENS

$$P = \frac{1}{f}$$

- SI unit: **Dioptre (D)**
- 1 D = 1 m⁻¹
- Convex lens: P is **positive**
- Concave lens: P is **negative**

## 2.16 HUMAN EYE

### Structure
| Part | Function |
|------|----------|
| **Cornea** | Thin transparent layer; main refracting surface |
| **Iris** | Coloured part; controls light entering pupil |
| **Pupil** | Pathway for light to retina |
| **Retina** | Back surface; real, inverted image formed here |
| **Eye Lens** | Convex lens; converges light |
| **Ciliary Muscles** | Change focal length of eye lens |

### Working
1. Cornea bends light through pupil
2. Eye lens converges light
3. Real, inverted image formed on retina
4. Retina sends signals to brain via optic nerves
5. Brain interprets as erect image

### Power of Accommodation
Ability of eye lens to focus nearby and distant objects by changing focal length using ciliary muscles.

- Distant object: ciliary muscles relax → lens thinner → focal length increases
- Near object: ciliary muscles contract → lens thicker → focal length decreases

### Persistence of Vision
If time interval between two consecutive light pulses < 1/16 second, eye cannot distinguish them separately.

### Far Point and Near Point
- **Near point (D):** 25 cm for normal eye
- **Far point:** Infinity for normal eye

---

## 2.17 DEFECTS OF VISION

### Myopia (Short-sightedness)
- **Cause:** Eyeball lengthened; focal length reduced
- **Effect:** Can see near objects, cannot see distant objects
- **Image formation:** In front of retina
- **Correction:** Concave lens

**Focal length of correcting lens:**
$$f = \frac{xy}{x-y}$$

Where x = far point of defective eye, y = desired far point (∞ or specific distance)

### Hypermetropia (Long-sightedness)
- **Cause:** Eyeball shortened; focal length increased
- **Effect:** Can see distant objects, cannot see near objects
- **Image formation:** Behind retina
- **Correction:** Convex lens

**Focal length of correcting lens:**
$$f = \frac{dD}{d-D}$$

Where d = near point of defective eye, D = 25 cm (normal near point)

### Presbyopia
- Due to ageing; ciliary muscles become weak, lens becomes rigid
- Loss of accommodation power
- **Correction:** Bifocal lenses (upper: concave for distance, lower: convex for reading)

### Astigmatism
- Cannot see parallel and horizontal lines clearly
- Due to imperfect structure of eye lens
- **Correction:** Cylindrical lenses

## POINTS TO REMEMBER

| Concept | Formula/Key Point |
|---------|-----------------|
| Refractive index | μ = c/v |
| Lens formula | 1/f = 1/v - 1/u |
| Magnification | m = h'/h = v/u |
| Power of lens | P = 1/f |
| Lens maker's formula | 1/f = (μ-1)(1/R₁ - 1/R₂) |
| Myopia correction | f = xy/(x-y) |

## SOLVED PROBLEMS

### Problem 1
Light travels from vacuum into glass (μ = 1.5). Angle of incidence = 30°. Find angle of refraction.

**Solution:**
Using Snell's law: μ₁ sin i = μ₂ sin r
- 1.0 × sin 30° = 1.5 × sin r
- 0.5 = 1.5 sin r
- sin r = 0.333
- **r = 19.45°**

### Problem 2
Diverging lens: f = -0.3 m, image appears at v = -0.2 m behind lens. Find object position.

**Solution:**
1/f = 1/v - 1/u
- 1/u = 1/v - 1/f = 1/(-0.2) - 1/(-0.3) = -5 + 3.33 = -1.67
- **u = -0.6 m** (or 0.6 m in front of lens)

### Problem 3
Myopic person can see up to 4 m. Wants to see up to 20 m. Find focal length and power of correcting lens.

**Solution:**
f = xy/(x-y) = (4 × 20)/(4-20) = 80/(-16) = **-5 m**
P = 1/f = -1/5 = **-0.2 D**

### Problem 4
Hypermetropic person has near point at 1.5 m. Find focal length of correction lens (normal D = 25 cm = 0.25 m).

**Solution:**
f = dD/(d-D) = (1.5 × 0.25)/(1.5 - 0.25) = 0.375/1.25 = **0.3 m**
