## Introduction
The word hormone is derived from the Greek word “hormon” meaning “ to excite”. The function of control and coordination in plants is performed by chemical substances produced by the plants called plant hormones. In plants several cells are capable of producing hormones. These phytohormones are transported to different parts of the plants to perform various physiological functions. 

Endocrine glands in vertebrate animals possess a diversified communication system to co-ordinate physiological and metabolic functions by chemical integration. The endocrine system acts through chemical messengers known as hormones which are produced by specialized glands. Physiological processes such as digestion, metabolism, growth, development and reproduction are controlled by hormones.

## 16.1 Plant Hormones
Plant hormones are organic molecules that are produced at extremely low concentration in plants. These molecules control morphological, physiological and biochemical responses. 

## Types of Plant Hormones

There are five major classes of plant hormones:

1. **Auxins**
2. **Cytokinins**
3. **Gibberellins**
4. **Abscisic Acid (ABA)**
5. **Ethylene**

Among all these plant hormones, **auxins, cytokinins, and gibberellins** promote plant growth while **abscisic acid and ethylene** inhibit plant growth.

## 16.1.1 Auxins

Auxins (Gk. *auxein* = to grow) were the first plant hormones discovered. The term auxin was introduced by Kogl and Haagen-Smith (1931). Auxins are produced at the tip of stems and roots from where they migrate to the zone of elongation.

Charles Darwin (1880) observed unilateral growth and curvature of canary grass (*Phalaris canariensis*) coleoptiles. He concluded that some 'influence' was transmitted from the tip of the coleoptile to the basal region. This 'influence' was later identified as Auxin.

### 16.1.1.1 Went's Experiment

Frits Warmolt Went (1903–1990), a Dutch biologist, demonstrated the existence and effect of auxin in plants. He did a series of experiments in Avena coleoptiles. 

In his first experiment he removed the tips of Avena coleoptiles. The cut tips did not grow indicating that the tips produced something essential for growth.In his second experiment he placed the agar blocks on the decapitated coleoptile tips. The coleoptile tips did not show any response. In his next experiment he placed the detached coleoptile tips on agar blocks. After an hour, he discarded the tips and placed this agar block on the decapitated coleoptile. It grew straight up indicating that some chemical had diffused from the cut coleoptile tips into the agar block which stimulated the growth. 

From his experiments Went concluded that a chemical diffusing from the tip of coleoptiles was responsible for growth, and he named it as “Auxin” meaning "to grow”.

 **Types of Auxins:** Auxins are classified into two types, namely natural auxins and synthetic auxins.
1.  **Natural Auxins:** Auxins produced by the plants are called natural auxins. Example: IAA (Indole – 3 - Acetic Acid)
2.  **Synthetic Auxins:**  Artificially synthesized auxins that have properties like auxins are called as synthetic auxins. Example: 2,4 D (2,4 Dichlorophenoxy Acetic Acid). 

**Physiological effects of auxins:** Auxins bring about a variety of physiological effects in different parts of the plant body. 

1. Auxins promote the elongation of stems and coleoptiles which makes them to grow.
![](img3.png)
2. Auxins induce root formation at low concentration and inhibit it at higher concentration.
3. The auxins produced by the apical buds suppress growth of lateral buds. This is called apical dominance.
4. Seedless fruits without fertilization are induced by the external application of auxins. (Parthenocarpy). Examples: Watermelon, Grapes, Lime etc.
5. Auxins prevent the formation of abscission layer. 


> **Do You Know** Phenyl Acetic Acid (PAA) and Indole 3 Acetonitrile (IAN) are natural auxins. Indole 3 Butyric Acid (IBA), Indole-3-Propionic Acid, α-Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA), 2, 4, 5-T (2,4,5 Trichlorophenoxy Acetic Acid) are some of the synthetic auxins.

---

## 16.1.2 Cytokinins

Cytokinins (*Cytos* = cell; *kinesis* = division) are plant hormones that promote cell division or cytokinesis in plant cells. First isolated from Herring fish sperm. **Zeatin** was the cytokinin isolated from *Zea mays*. Found abundantly in liquid endosperm of coconut.

### Physiological Effects of Cytokinins

1. Cytokinin induces cell division (cytokinesis) in the presence of auxins.
2. Cytokinin also causes cell enlargement.
3. Both auxins and cytokinins are essential for the formation of new organs from the callus in tissue culture (Morphogenesis).
4. Cytokinins promote the growth of lateral buds even in the presence of apical bud.
5. Application of cytokinin delays the process of ageing in plants. This is called Richmond Lang effect.

---

## 16.1.3 Gibberellins

Gibberellins are the most abundantly found plant hormones. Kurosawa (1926) observed **Bakanae disease** or  **foolish seedling disease** in rice crops. This internodal elongation in rice was caused by fungus Gibberella fujikuroi. The active substance was identified as **Gibberellic acid**.

The most abundantly found plant hormones. Kurosawa (1926) observed  (foolish seedling disease) in rice crops. This internodal elongation was caused by fungus *Gibberella fujikuroi*. The active substance was identified as Gibberellic acid.

### Physiological Effects of Gibberellins

1. Application of gibberellins on plants stimulate extraordinary elongation of internode. e.g. Corn and Pea.

![](img4.png)

2. Treatment of rosette plants with gibberellin induces sudden shoot elongation followed by flowering. This is called bolting.
3. Gibberellins promote the production of male flowers in monoecious plants (Cucurbits).
4. Gibberellins break dormancy of potato tubers.
5. Gibberellins are efficient than auxins in inducing the formation of seedless fruit - Parthenocarpic fruits (Development of fruits without fertilization) e.g. Tomato.

---

## 16.1.4 Abscisic Acid (ABA)

Abscisic acid (ABA) is a growth inhibitor which regulates abscission and dormancy. It increases tolerance of plants to various kinds of stress. So, it is also called as**stress hormone**. It is found in the chloroplast of plants. 

### Physiological Effects of Abscisic Acid

1. ABA promotes the process of abscission (separation of leaves, flowers and fruits from the branch).
2. During water stress and drought conditions ABA causes stomatal closure. 

![](img5.png)

> **Activity** Place two or three unripe tomatoes in a brown paper bag with a ripe bananas and roll the top closed. In another bag place two or three unripe tomatoes only and roll the top closed, Observe what happens to the tomatoes? Why?

As the banana continues to ripen in the first bag, it produces ethylene gas. The gas trapped in the bag will cause tomatoes to ripen.The tomatoes remain unripe in the second bag


3. ABA promotes senescence in leaves by causing loss of chlorophyll.
4. ABA induces bud dormancy towards the approach of winter in trees like birch.
5. ABA is a powerful inhibitor of lateral bud growth in tomato.

---

## 16.1.5 Ethylene

A **gaseous plant hormone** and growth inhibitor. Mainly concerned with maturation and ripening of fruits. Maximum synthesis occurs during ripening of apples, bananas, and melons.

### Activity: Fruit Ripening

Place unripe tomatoes in a paper bag with a ripe banana. The banana produces ethylene gas, causing tomatoes to ripen. Tomatoes without banana remain unripe.

### Physiological Effects of Ethylene

1. Promotes ripening of fruits (Tomato, Apple, Mango, Banana, etc)
![](img6.png)
2. Inhibits elongation of stem and root in dicots
3. Hastens senescence of leaves and flowers
4. Stimulates formation of abscission zone → premature shedding
5. Breaks dormancy of buds, seeds, and storage organs
