## Introduction

The word hormone is derived from the Greek word "hormon" meaning "to excite". The function of control and coordination in plants is performed by chemical substances produced by the plants called plant hormones. In plants several cells are capable of producing hormones. These phytohormones are transported to different parts of the plants to perform various physiological functions.

Endocrine glands in vertebrate animals possess a diversified communication system to co-ordinate physiological and metabolic functions by chemical integration. The endocrine system acts through chemical messengers known as hormones which are produced by specialized glands. Physiological processes such as digestion, metabolism, growth, development and reproduction are controlled by hormones.

## 16.1 Plant Hormones

Plant hormones are organic molecules that are produced at extremely low concentration in plants. These molecules control morphological, physiological and biochemical activities.

### Types of Plant Hormones

There are five major classes of plant hormones:

1. **Auxins**
2. **Cytokinins**
3. **Gibberellins**
4. **Abscisic Acid (ABA)**
5. **Ethylene**

Among all these plant hormones, **auxins, cytokinins and gibberellins promote plant growth** while **abscisic acid and ethylene inhibit plant growth**.

---

## 16.1.1 Auxins

Auxins (Gk. *auxein* = to grow) were the first plant hormones discovered. The term auxin was introduced by Kogl and Haagen-Smith (1931). Auxins are produced at the tip of stems and roots from where they migrate to the zone of elongation.

Charles Darwin (1880) observed unilateral growth and curvature of canary grass (*Phalaris canariensis*) coleoptiles. He came to the conclusion that some 'influence' was transmitted from the tip of the coleoptile to the basal region. This 'influence' was later identified as Auxin.

### 16.1.1.1 Went's Experiment

**Frits Warmolt Went** (1903–1990), a Dutch biologist demonstrated the existence and effect of auxin in plants. He did a series of experiments in *Avena*.

- **First experiment:** He removed the tips of *Avena* coleoptiles. The cut tips did not grow, indicating that the tips produced something essential for growth.
- **Second experiment:** He placed agar blocks on the decapitated coleoptile tips. The coleoptile tips did not show any response.
- **Third experiment:** He placed the detached coleoptile tips on agar blocks. After an hour, he discarded the tips and placed this agar block on the decapitated coleoptile. It grew straight up, indicating that some chemical had diffused from the cut coleoptile tips into the agar block which stimulated the growth.

From his experiments, Went concluded that a chemical diffusing from the tip of coleoptiles was responsible for growth, and he named it **"Auxin"** meaning 'to grow'.

### Types of Auxins

| Type | Description | Examples |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Natural Auxins** | Auxins produced by the plants | IAA (Indole-3-Acetic Acid), PAA (Phenyl Acetic Acid), IAN (Indole-3-Acetonitrile) |
| **Synthetic Auxins** | Artificially synthesized auxins with auxin-like properties | 2,4-D (2,4-Dichlorophenoxy Acetic Acid), IBA (Indole-3-Butyric Acid), NAA (α-Naphthalene Acetic Acid), 2,4,5-T |

### Physiological Effects of Auxins

1. **Cell Elongation:** Auxins promote the elongation of stems and coleoptiles
2. **Root Formation:** Induce root formation at low concentration; inhibit at higher concentration
3. **Apical Dominance:** Auxins produced by apical buds suppress growth of lateral buds
4. **Parthenocarpy:** Seedless fruits without fertilization (e.g., Watermelon, Grapes, Lime)
5. **Prevents Abscission:** Auxins prevent the formation of abscission zone

---

## 16.1.2 Cytokinins

Cytokinins (*Cytos* - cell; *kinesis* - division) are plant hormones that promote cell division or cytokinesis in plant cells. First isolated from Herring fish sperm. **Zeatin** was the cytokinin isolated from *Zea mays*. Found abundantly in liquid endosperm of coconut.

### Physiological Effects of Cytokinins

1. Induces cell division (cytokinesis) in the presence of auxins
2. Causes cell enlargement
3. Essential for morphogenesis (formation of new organs from callus in tissue culture)
4. Promotes growth of lateral buds even in presence of apical bud
5. **Richmond-Lang Effect:** Delays the process of ageing in plants

---

## 16.1.3 Gibberellins

Gibberellins are the most abundantly found plant hormones. **Kurosawa (1926)** observed Bakanae disease or "foolish seedling disease" in rice crops. This internodal elongation was caused by fungus *Gibberella fujikuroi*. The active substance was identified as Gibberellic acid.

### Physiological Effects of Gibberellins

1. **Stem Elongation:** Stimulates extraordinary elongation of internode (e.g., Corn and sugarcane)
2. **Bolting:** Treatment of rosette plants induces sudden shoot elongation followed by flowering
3. **Male Flowers:** Promotes production of male flowers in monoecious plants (Cucurbits)
4. **Dormancy:** Breaks dormancy of potato tubers
5. **Parthenocarpy:** More efficient than auxins in inducing seedless fruits

---

## 16.1.4 Abscisic Acid (ABA)

Abscisic acid is a **growth inhibitor** which regulates abscission and dormancy. It increases tolerance of plants to various kinds of stress, so it is also called **stress hormone**. Found in chloroplast of plants.

### Physiological Effects of Abscisic Acid

1. **Abscission:** Promotes separation of leaves, flowers and fruits from branch
2. **Stomatal Closure:** During water stress and drought conditions, ABA causes stomatal closure
3. **Senescence:** Promotes senescence in leaves by causing loss of chlorophyll
4. **Bud Dormancy:** Induces bud dormancy towards approach of winter in trees like birch
5. **Lateral Bud Growth:** Powerful inhibitor of lateral bud growth in plants

---

## 16.1.5 Ethylene

Ethylene is a **gaseous plant hormone** and **growth inhibitor**. Mainly concerned with maturation and ripening of fruits. Maximum synthesis occurs during ripening of fruits like apples, bananas and melons.

### Activity
*Place unripe tomatoes in a paper bag with ripe bananas. The banana produces ethylene gas, causing tomatoes to ripen.*

### Physiological Effects of Ethylene

1. **Fruit Ripening:** Promotes ripening of fruits (Tomato, Apple, Mango, Banana)
2. **Inhibits Elongation:** Inhibits elongation of stem and root in dicots
3. **Senescence:** Hastens senescence of leaves and flowers
4. **Abscission:** Stimulates formation of abscission zone, leading to premature shedding
5. **Dormancy:** Breaks dormancy of buds, seeds and storage organs

## 16.2 Human Endocrine Glands

Endocrine glands in animals possess a versatile communication system to coordinate biological functions. **Exocrine glands** have specific ducts to carry their secretions (e.g., salivary glands, mammary glands, sweat glands). **Endocrine glands** are ductless glands; their secretions (hormones) diffuse into the bloodstream and act on specific target organs.

> **Endocrinology:** Branch of biology dealing with study of endocrine glands and their physiology.
> **Thomas Addison:** Father of Endocrinology
> **W.M. Bayliss and E.H. Starling:** Introduced the term hormone in 1909; discovered secretin

   - Causes stomatal closure during water stress

4. To prevent leaf fall and fruit drop: Apply **auxins** externally because auxins prevent formation of abscission zone.

5. **Chemical messengers** are hormones - substances produced by endocrine glands that travel through blood to target organs to coordinate physiological activities.

6. **Differences between endocrine and exocrine glands:**

| Endocrine Glands | Exocrine Glands |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Ductless glands | Have specific ducts |
| Secrete hormones | Secrete enzymes/other substances |
| Secretions diffuse into blood | Secretions carried through ducts |
| Act on distant target organs | Act locally or at specific sites |
