## Introduction

The word **hormone** is derived from the Greek word "hormon" meaning "to excite". The function of control and coordination in plants is performed by chemical substances produced by the plants called **plant hormones**. In plants several cells are capable of producing hormones. These phytohormones are transported to different parts of the plants to perform various physiological functions.

Endocrine glands in vertebrate animals possess a diversified communication system to co-ordinate physiological and metabolic functions by chemical integration. The endocrine system acts through chemical messengers known as **hormones** which are produced by specialized glands. Physiological processes such as digestion, metabolism, growth, development and reproduction are controlled by hormones.

## 16.1 Plant Hormones

Plant hormones are organic molecules that are produced at extremely low concentration in plants. These molecules control morphological, physiological and biochemical activities.

### Types of Plant Hormones

There are five major classes of plant hormones:

| No. | Hormone | Category |
|:---:|:---|:---|
| 1 | **Auxins** | Growth Promoter |
| 2 | **Cytokinins** | Growth Promoter |
| 3 | **Gibberellins** | Growth Promoter |
| 4 | **Abscisic Acid (ABA)** | Growth Inhibitor |
| 5 | **Ethylene** | Growth Inhibitor |

> **Key Concept:** Auxins, cytokinins and gibberellins **promote** plant growth while abscisic acid and ethylene **inhibit** plant growth.

---

### 16.1.1 Auxins

**Auxins** (Gk. *auxein* = to grow) were the first plant hormones discovered. The term auxin was introduced by Kogl and Haagen-Smith (1931). Auxins are produced at the tip of stems and roots from where they migrate to the zone of elongation.

**Historical Discovery:**
- **Charles Darwin (1880)** observed unilateral growth and curvature of canary grass (*Phalaris canariensis*) coleoptiles
- He concluded that some 'influence' was transmitted from the tip of the coleoptile to the basal region
- This 'influence' was later identified as **Auxin**

#### 16.1.1.1 Went's Experiment

**Frits Warmolt Went (1903–1990)**, a Dutch biologist demonstrated the existence and effect of auxin in plants through a series of experiments in *Avena* (oat).

| Experiment | Procedure | Result |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **First** | Removed the tips of *Avena* coleoptiles | No growth - tips produced something essential for growth |
| **Second** | Placed agar blocks on decapitated coleoptile tips | No response |
| **Third** | Placed detached coleoptile tips on agar blocks for 1 hour, then placed this agar block on decapitated coleoptile | Grew straight up - chemical diffused from tip into agar |

**Conclusion:** A chemical diffusing from the tip of coleoptiles was responsible for growth, named **"Auxin"** (meaning 'to grow').

#### Types of Auxins

| Type | Description | Examples |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Natural Auxins** | Produced by plants | IAA (Indole-3-Acetic Acid), PAA (Phenyl Acetic Acid), IAN (Indole-3-Acetonitrile) |
| **Synthetic Auxins** | Artificially synthesized | 2,4-D (2,4-Dichlorophenoxy Acetic Acid), IBA (Indole-3-Butyric Acid), NAA (α-Naphthalene Acetic Acid), 2,4,5-T |

#### Physiological Effects of Auxins

1. **Cell Elongation** - Promote elongation of stems and coleoptiles
2. **Root Formation** - Induce root formation at low concentration; inhibit at higher concentration
3. **Apical Dominance** - Auxins produced by apical buds suppress growth of lateral buds
4. **Parthenocarpy** - Induce seedless fruits without fertilization (e.g., Watermelon, Grapes, Lime)
5. **Prevent Abscission** - Prevent formation of abscission layer

---

### 16.1.2 Cytokinins

**Cytokinins** (*Cytos* - cell; *kinesis* - division) are plant hormones that promote cell division or cytokinesis in plant cells.

- First isolated from Herring fish sperm
- **Zeatin** was the cytokinin isolated from *Zea mays*
- Found abundantly in liquid endosperm of coconut (coconut milk)

#### Physiological Effects of Cytokinins

1. Induce cell division (cytokinesis) in the presence of auxins
2. Cause cell enlargement
3. Essential for formation of new organs from callus in tissue culture (**Morphogenesis**)
4. Promote growth of lateral buds even in presence of apical bud
5. **Richmond-Lang effect** - Delay the process of ageing in plants

---

### 16.1.3 Gibberellins

Gibberellins are the most abundantly found plant hormones.

**Discovery:** Kurosawa (1926) observed **Bakanae disease** (foolish seedling disease) in rice crops. This internodal elongation was caused by fungus *Gibberella fujikuroi*. The active substance was identified as **Gibberellic acid**.

#### Physiological Effects of Gibberellins

1. **Internodal Elongation** - Stimulate extraordinary elongation of internode (e.g., Corn, Sugarcane)
2. **Bolting** - Treatment of rosette plants induces sudden shoot elongation followed by flowering
3. **Male Flower Production** - Promote production of male flowers in monoecious plants (Cucurbits)
4. **Break Dormancy** - Break dormancy of potato tubers
5. **Parthenocarpy** - More efficient than auxins in inducing seedless fruits

---

### 16.1.4 Abscisic Acid (ABA)

**Abscisic acid (ABA)** is a growth inhibitor which regulates abscission and dormancy. It increases tolerance of plants to various kinds of stress, so it is also called **stress hormone**. Found in chloroplast of plants.

#### Physiological Effects of Abscisic Acid

1. **Abscission** - Promotes separation of leaves, flowers and fruits from the branch
2. **Stomatal Closure** - During water stress and drought conditions, causes stomatal closure
3. **Senescence** - Promotes senescence in leaves by causing loss of chlorophyll
4. **Bud Dormancy** - Induces bud dormancy towards approach of winter in trees like birch
5. **Inhibits Lateral Bud Growth** - Powerful inhibitor of lateral bud growth in tomato

---

### 16.1.5 Ethylene

**Ethylene** is a **gaseous** plant hormone. It is a growth inhibitor mainly concerned with maturation and ripening of fruits. Maximum synthesis occurs during ripening of fruits like apples, bananas and melons.

> **Activity:** Place unripe tomatoes in a paper bag with ripe bananas. The banana produces ethylene gas, causing tomatoes to ripen. Tomatoes alone in a bag remain unripe.

#### Physiological Effects of Ethylene

1. **Fruit Ripening** - Promotes ripening of fruits (Tomato, Apple, Mango, Banana)
2. **Inhibits Elongation** - Inhibits elongation of stem and root in dicots
3. **Senescence** - Hastens senescence of leaves and flowers
4. **Abscission Zone** - Stimulates formation of abscission zone, leading to premature shedding
5. **Breaks Dormancy** - Breaks dormancy of buds, seeds and storage organs
