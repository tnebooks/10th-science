## Introduction
- List the basic events of aerobic and anaerobic respiration
- List the basic events of aerobic and anaerobic respiration
Plants exhibits varying degrees of organization. Atoms are organized into molecules, molecules into organelles, organelles into cells, cells into tissues and tissues into organs. The first account of internal structure of plants was published by English Physician Nehemiah Grew. He is known as Father of Plant Anatomy. Plant anatomy (Gk Ana = as under; Temnein = to cut) is the study of internal structure of plants. You have already studied the different kinds of tissues in standard IX. In this lesson, you will study about the internal structure of plant tissues, process of photosynthesis and respiration.

## 12.1 Tissues
Tissues are the group of cells that are similar or dissimilar in structure and origin, but perform similar function. Plant tissues can be broadly classified into two, based on their ability to divide. They are:

i) Meristamatic tissue

ii) Permanent tissue

## 12.2 Tissue System
Sachs (1875) classified tissue system in plants into three types:

i) Dermal or Epidermal tissue system

ii) Ground tissue system

iii) Vascular tissue system

The functions of these tissues are given in Table 12.1

### Table 12.1 Tissue system and its functions

| Tissue System | Components | Functions |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Dermal Tissue System | Epidermis and Periderm (in older stems and roots) | · Protection · Prevention of water loss |
| Ground Tissue System | Parenchyma tissue, Chlorenchyma, Collenchyma tissue, Sclerenchyma tissue | · Food storage · Photosynthesis · Support, protection · Support, rigidity |
| Vascular Tissue System | Vascular tissues - Xylem tissue - Phloem tissue | · Transport of water and minerals · Transport of food |

### 12.2.1 Dermal or Epidermal Tissue System
It consists of epidermis, stomata and epidermal outgrowths. Epidermis is the outer most layer. Minute pores called stomata are present in the epidermis of leaf and stem.

Cuticle is present on the outer wall of epidermis to check evaporation of water. Trichomes and root hairs are the epidermal

#### Functions:

i) Epidermis protects the inner tissues.

ii) Stomata helps in transpiration.

iii) Root hairs help in absorption of water and minerals.

### 12.2.2 Ground Tissue System
It includes all the tissues of the plant body except epidermal and vascular tissues like:
(i) Cortex
(ii) Endodermis
(iii) Pericycle
(iv) Pith

### 12.2.3 Vascular Tissue System
It consists of xylem and phloem tissues. They are present in the form of bundles called vascular bundles. Xylem conducts water and minerals to different parts of the plant. Phloem conducts food materials to different parts of the

There are three different types of vascular bundles namely:
(i) Radial
(ii) Conjoint
(iii) Concentric

#### (i) Radial Bundles
Xylem and phloem are present in different radii alternating with each other. e.g. roots

#### (ii) Conjoint bundles
Xylem and phloem lie on the same radius. There are two types of conjoint

##### a) Collateral
Xylem lies towards the centre and phloem lies towards the

When cambium is present in collateral bundles, it is called open. e.g. dicot stem and collateral bundle without cambium is called closed. e.g. monocot

##### b) Bicollateral
In this type of bundle, the phloem is present on both outer and inner side of xylem. e.g. Cucurbita

#### (iii) Concentric Bundles
Vascular bundle in which xylem completely surrounds the phloem or vice versa is called concentric vascular bundle. It is of two types:

1. **Amphivasal**: Xylem surrounds phloem. e.g. Dracaena
2. **Amphicribral**: Phloem surrounds xylem. e.g. Ferns

**Endarch**: Protoxylem lies towards the centre and metaxylem lies towards the

**Exarch**: Protoxylem lies towards the periphery and metaxylem lies towards the

## 12.9 Plant Physiology

### 12.9.1 Plastids
Plastids are double membrane bound organelles found in plants and some algae. They are responsible for preparation and storage of food. There are three types of plastids.
- Chloroplast - green coloured plastids
- Chromoplast - yellow, red, orange coloured plastids
- Leucoplast - colourless plastids

### 12.9.2 Structure of Chloroplast
Chloroplasts are green plastids containing green pigment called chlorophyll. Chloroplasts are oval shaped organelles having a diameter of 2-10 micrometer and a thickness of 1-2 micrometer.


![](Ultrastructure.png)


**Figure 12.8** Ultrastructure of Chloroplast

1. **Envelope**: Chloroplast envelope has outer and inner membranes which is separated by intermembrane space.

2. **Stroma**: Matrix present inside to the membrane is called stroma. It contains DNA, 70S ribosomes and other molecules required for protein synthesis.

3. **Thylakoids**: It consists of thylakoid membrane that encloses thylakoid lumen. Photosynthetic pigments are present in thylakoids. Thylakoids forms a stack of disc like structures called a grana (singular - granum).

4. **Grana**: Thylakoids arranged in the form of discs stacked one above the other called granum. Grana are inter connected by stroma lamella.

### 12.9.3 Functions of Chloroplast
1. Photosynthesis
2. Storage of starch
3. Synthesis of fatty acids
4. Storage of lipids
5. Formation of chloroplasts

### 12.9.4 Photosynthesis
Photosynthesis (Photo = light; synthesis = to build) is a process by which autotrophic organisms like green plants, algae and chlorophyll containing bacteria utilize the energy from sunlight to synthesize their own food. In this process, carbon dioxide combines with water in the presence of sunlight and chlorophyll to form carbohydrates. During this process oxygen is released as a by-product.

**Chemical Equation:**
```
6CO₂ + 12H₂O → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂↑ + 6H₂O
Carbon dioxide + Water → Glucose + Oxygen + Water
```

### 12.9.5 Where does photosynthesis occur?
Photosynthesis occurs in all green parts of the plant especially in green

### 12.9.6 Photosynthetic Pigments
Pigments involved in photosynthesis are called Photosynthetic pigments. Photosynthetic pigments are of two classes namely, the primary pigments and accessory pigments. Chlorophyll a is the primary pigment that traps solar energy and converts it into electrical and chemical energy. Thus it is called the reaction centre. Other pigments such as chlorophyll b and carotenoids are called accessory pigments as they pass on the absorbed energy to chlorophyll a (Chl.a) molecule. Reaction centre (Primary pigments) and harvesting centre (Accessary pigments) together form photo

### 12.9.7 Role of Sunlight in Photosynthesis
The entire process of photosynthesis takes place inside the chloroplast. The structure of chloroplast is such that the light dependent (Light reaction) and light independent (Dark reaction) take place at different sites in the organelle

#### 1. Light dependent Reaction (Hill reaction / Light reaction)
This was discovered by Robin Hill (1939). This reaction takes place in the presence of light energy in thylakoid membranes (grana) of the chloroplasts. Photosynthetic pigments absorb the light energy and convert it into chemical energy ATP and NADPH+H⁺. These products of light reaction move out from the thylakoid to the stroma of the

| Abbreviation | Full Form |
|:---|:---|
| ATP | Adenosine Tri Phosphate |
| ADP | Adenosine Di Phosphate |
| NAD | Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide |
| NADP | Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate |

> **Do You Know?**
> A cell cannot get its energy directly from glucose. So in respiration the energy released from glucose is used to make ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate)

#### 2. Light independent reactions (Dark reaction) (Biosynthetic phase)
Dark reaction or biosynthetic pathway takes place in stroma. During this reaction CO₂ is reduced into carbohydrates with the help of light generated ATP and NADPH+H⁺. This is also called as Calvin cycle and is carried out in the absence of light. It is called dark

In Calvin cycle the inputs are CO₂ from the atmosphere and the ATP and NADPH+H⁺ produced from light

i) Pigments
ii) Leaf age
iii) Accumulation of carbohydrates
iv) Hormones

#### b) External Factors:
i) Light
ii) Carbon dioxide
iii) Temperature
iv) Water
v) Mineral elements

> **Info bit:** Artificial photosynthesis is a method for producing renewable energy by the use of sunlight. Indian scientist C.N.R. Rao who was conferred the Bharat Ratna (2013) is also working on similar technology of artificial photosynthesis to produce Hydrogen fuel (renewable energy).

## 12.10 Mitochondria
Mitochondria are filamentous or granular cytoplasmic organelles present in cells. The mitochondria were first discovered by Kolliker in 1857 as granular structures in striated muscles. Mitochondria (singular: mitochondrion) are organelles within eukaryotic cells that produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) which form the energy currency of the cell, for this reason, the mitochondria is referred to as the "Power house of the cell". Mitochondria vary in size from 0.5μm to 2.0μm. Mitochondria contain 60-70% protein, 25-30% lipids, 5-7% RNA and small amount of DNA and

### 12.10.1 Structure of Mitochondria

**Mitochondrial Membranes**: It consists two membranes called inner and outer membrane. Each membrane is 60-70Å thick. Outer mitochondrial membrane is smooth and freely permeable to most small molecules. It contains enzymes, proteins and lipids. It has porin molecules (proteins) which form channels for passage of molecules through

Inner mitochondrial membrane is semi permeable membrane and regulates the passage of materials into and out of the mitochondria. It is rich in enzymes and carrier proteins. It consists of 80% proteins and


![](Mitochondria.png)


**Figure 12.10** Structure of Mitochondria

**Cristae**: The inner mitochondrial membrane gives rise to finger like projections called cristae. These cristae increase the inner surface area (fold in inner membrane) of the mitochondria to hold variety of enzymes.

**Oxysomes**: The inner mitochondrial membrane bear minute regularly spaced tennis racket shaped particles known as oxysomes (F₁ particle). They involve in ATP synthesis.


![](oxyzomes.png)

**Figure 12.11** Structure of Oxysomes

**Mitochondrial matrix**: It is a complex mixture of proteins and lipids. Matrix contains enzymes for Krebs cycle, mitochondrial ribosomes (70S), tRNAs and mitochondrial DNA.

### 12.10.2 Functions of Mitochondria
- Mitochondria is the main organelle of cell respiration. They produce a large number of ATP molecules. So they are called as power houses of the cell or ATP factory of the cell.
- It helps the cells to maintain normal concentration of calcium ions.
- It regulates the metabolic activity of the cell.

## 12.11 TYPES OF RESPIRATION
Respiration involves exchange of gases between the organism and the external environment. The plants obtain oxygen from their environment and release carbon dioxide and water vapour. This exchange of gases is known as external respiration. It is a physical process. Biochemical process occurs within cells where the food is oxidized to obtain energy, this is known as cellular respiration

### 12.11.1 Aerobic respiration
Aerobic respiration is the type of cellular respiration in which organic food is completely oxidized with the help of oxygen into carbon dioxide, water and energy. It occurs in most plants and animals.

**Chemical Equation:**
```
C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂ → 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + ATP
```

#### Stages of Aerobic respiration

**a. Glycolysis (Glucose splitting)**: It is the breakdown of one molecule of glucose (6 carbon) into two molecules of pyruvic acid (3 carbon). Glycolysis takes place in cytoplasm of the cell. It is the first step of both aerobic and anaerobic respiration.

**b. Krebs Cycle**: This cycle occurs in mitochondria matrix. At the end of glycolysis, 2 molecules of pyruvic acid enter into mitochondria. The oxidation of pyruvic acid into CO₂ and water takes place through this cycle. It is also called Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle (TCA).

**c. Electron Transport Chain**: This is accomplished through a system of electron carrier complex called electron transport chain (ETC) located on the inner membrane of the mitochondria. NADH+H⁺ and FADH₂ molecules formed during glycolysis and Krebs cycle are oxidised to NAD⁺ and FAD to release the energy via electrons. The electrons, as they move through the system, release energy which is trapped by ADP to synthesize ATP. This is called oxidative phosphorylation. In this process, O₂ the ultimate acceptor of electrons gets reduced to water.

### 12.11.2 Anaerobic respiration
Anaerobic respiration takes place without oxygen. Glucose is converted into ethanol (Ethanol fermentation by yeast) or lactic acid (lactic acid fermentation by bacteria).

**Chemical Equation:**
```
C₆H₁₂O₆ → 2CO₂ + 2C₂H₅OH + Energy (ATP)
```

### 12.11.3 Respiratory quotient (R.Q)
Respiratory quotient is the ratio of volume of carbon dioxide liberated and the volume of oxygen consumed during respiration. It is expressed as

```
RQ = Volume of CO₂ liberated / Volume of O₂ consumed
```
