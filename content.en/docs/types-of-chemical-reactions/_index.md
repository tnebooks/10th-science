## INTRODUCTION

As you know from your earlier studies, a chemical reaction involves breaking of old chemical bonds and formation of new chemical bonds. This change may happen spontaneously or it may be facilitated by external forces or energy. Chemistry is all about chemical reactions. In your day to day life, you could observe many chemical reactions. A clear understanding of these reactions is essential in order to manipulate them for the sake of human life and environment. So, chemistry mainly focuses on chemical reactions.

**Let us try to find the answer for the following questions:**
- You need energy to play, walk, run or to perform various physical activities. Where do you get the energy from?
- How do plants grow and get their food?
- How does a car move using fuel?
- Why does iron rust on its exposure to water or air?

**Answers:**
- You get energy from the digestion of the food you eat.
- Plants grow by absorbing nutrients from the Earth and get their food by photosynthesis.
- The combustion of a fuel makes the car to move.
- Oxidation of iron causes rusting.

So, all these processes are chemical changes i.e. the materials, which undergo changes are converted into some other new materials. For example, by burning petrol, the hydrocarbons present in it are converted into carbon dioxide and water.

---

## What happens during a chemical reaction?

- In a chemical reaction, the atoms of the reacting molecules or elements are rearranged to form new molecules.
- Old chemical bonds between atoms are broken and new chemical bonds are formed.
- Bond breaking absorbs energy whereas bond formation releases energy.

---

## How are chemical reactions represented?

When methane reacts with oxygen, it forms carbon dioxide and water.

**Word equation:**
> Methane + Oxygen → Carbon dioxide + Water

**Chemical equation:**
```
CH₄ + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O
```

**Balanced chemical equation:**
```
CH₄ + 2O₂ → CO₂ + 2H₂O
```

With physical states:
```
CH₄(g) + 2O₂(g) → CO₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)
```

### Physical State Symbols

| Symbol | Phase or Physical State |
|--------|------------------------|
| s | Solid |
| l | Liquid |
| g | Gas |
| aq | Aqueous Solution |

**Example:**
```
2K(s) + 2H₂O(l) → 2KOH(aq) + H₂(g)
```

## 10.1 TYPES OF CHEMICAL REACTIONS

### Classification based on the nature of rearrangements of atoms

#### (a) Combination reactions

A combination reaction is a reaction in which two or more reactants combine to form a compound. It is otherwise called 'synthesis reaction' or 'composition reaction'.

![](1.1.png)

**Example:** Hydrogen gas combines with chlorine gas to form hydrogen chloride gas.
```
H₂(g) + Cl₂(g) → 2HCl(g)
```

**Three classes of combination reactions:**

1. **Element + Element → Compound**
   
   *Example 1:* When solid sulphur reacts with oxygen, it produces sulphur dioxide.
   ```
   S(s) + O₂(g) → SO₂(g)
   ```
   
   *Example 2:* Sodium combines with chlorine to form sodium chloride.
   ```
   2Na(s) + Cl₂(g) → 2NaCl(s)
   ```

2. **Compound + Element → Compound**
   
   *Example:* Phosphorous trichloride reacts with chlorine gas.
   ```
   PCl₃(l) + Cl₂(g) → PCl₅(s)
   ```

3. **Compound + Compound → Compound**
   
   *Example:* Silicon dioxide reacts with calcium oxide.
   ```
   SiO₂(s) + CaO(s) → CaSiO₃(s)
   ```

> **Note:** Most of the combination reactions are exothermic in nature.

---

#### (b) Decomposition reactions

In a decomposition reaction, a single compound splits into two or more simpler substances under suitable conditions. It is the opposite of the combination reaction.

![](1.3.png)

**Three main classes:**

**(i) Thermal Decomposition Reactions (Thermolysis)**

In this type of reaction, the reactant is decomposed by applying heat (Thermolysis).

Similarly, when calcium carbonate is heated, it breaks down into calcium oxide and carbon dioxide.

$$\text{CaCO}_{3(s)} \xrightarrow{\text{Heat}} \text{CaO}_{(s)} + \text{CO}_{2(g)}$$

In thermal decomposition reaction, heat is supplied to break the bonds. Such reactions, in which heat is absorbed, are called **'Endothermic reactions'**.

**(ii) Electrolytic Decomposition Reactions (Electrolysis)**

Electrical energy is used to bring about the reaction.

*Example:* Decomposition of sodium chloride.
```
2NaCl(aq) --Electricity→ 2Na(s) + Cl₂(g)
```

**(iii) Photo Decomposition Reactions**

Light facilitates the decomposition (Photolysis).

*Example:* Silver bromide exposed to light.
```
2AgBr(s) --Light→ 2Ag(s) + Br₂(g)
```

> The yellow coloured silver bromide turns into grey coloured silver metal.

---

#### (c) Single Displacement Reactions

It is a reaction between an element and a compound. When they react, one of the elements of the compound-reactant is replaced by the element-reactant.

**General scheme:**
```
A + BC → AC + B
```

*Example 1:* Zinc metal in hydrochloric acid.
```
Zn(s) + 2HCl(aq) → ZnCl₂(aq) + H₂(g)
```

*Example 2:* Iron nail in copper (II) sulphate solution.
```
Fe(s) + CuSO₄(aq) → FeSO₄(aq) + Cu(s)
```

**Activity Series** (mnemonic: Please Send Lions, Cats, Monkeys, And Zebras Into Lovely Hot Countries Signed General Penguin)

| Activity | Element |
|----------|---------|
| Most active | Potassium (K) |
| | Sodium (Na) |
| | Lithium (Li) |
| | Calcium (Ca) |
| | Magnesium (Mg) |
| | Aluminium (Al) |
| | Zinc (Zn) |
| | Iron (Fe) |
| | Lead (Pb) |
| | Hydrogen (H) |
| | Copper (Cu) |
| | Silver (Ag) |
| | Gold (Au) |
| Least active | Platinum (Pt) |

> More active elements readily displace less active elements from their aqueous solution.

---

#### (d) Double Displacement Reactions

When two compounds react, if their ions are interchanged, then the reaction is called double displacement reaction (Metathesis Reaction).

![](1.5.png)

**Two major classes:**

**(i) Precipitation Reactions**

When aqueous solutions of two compounds are mixed, if they react to form an insoluble compound and a soluble compound.

*Example:* Potassium iodide and lead (II) nitrate.
```
Pb(NO₃)₂(aq) + 2KI(aq) → PbI₂(s)↓ + 2KNO₃(aq)
```

**(ii) Neutralization Reactions**

Acid reacts with base to form salt and water.

*Example 1:* Sodium hydroxide with hydrochloric acid.
```
NaOH(aq) + HCl(aq) → NaCl(aq) + H₂O(l)
```

*Example 2:* Ammonium hydroxide with nitric acid.
```
HNO₃(aq) + NH₄OH(aq) → NH₄NO₃(aq) + H₂O(l)
```

---

#### (e) Combustion Reactions

A **combustion reaction** is one in which the reactant rapidly combines with oxygen to form one or more oxides and energy (heat). So in combustion reactions, one of the reactants must be oxygen. Combustion reactions are majorly used as heat energy sources in many of our day to day activities.

**Example:** LPG is a mixture of hydrocarbon gases like propane, butane, propylene, etc. All these hydrocarbons burn with oxygen to form carbon dioxide and water.

$$\text{C}_3\text{H}_{8(g)} + 5\text{O}_{2(g)} \rightarrow 3\text{CO}_{2(g)} + 4\text{H}_2\text{O}_{(l)} + \text{Heat}$$

Since heat is evolved, it is an **exothermic reaction**. As oxygen is added, it is also an oxidation. So combustion may be called as an **exothermic oxidation**. If a flame is formed, then it is called **burning**.

![](4.png)


**Figure 10.4** Combustion of LPG gas


> **Conceptual Thought:** All combustion reactions are oxidations but all oxidations are not combustions. Why?
> 
> **Answer:** Combustion requires rapid reaction with oxygen producing heat and light (flame). Oxidation is a broader term that includes slow processes like rusting that don't produce flames.

### Table 10.1: Differences between combination and decomposition reactions

| COMBINATION REACTIONS | DECOMPOSITION REACTIONS |
|----------------------|------------------------|
| One or more reactants combine to form a single product | A single reactant is decomposed to form one or more products |
| Energy is released | Energy is absorbed |
| Elements or compounds may be the reactants | Single compound is the reactant |

---

### 10.1.2 Classification based on the direction of the reaction



![](5.png)



**Figure 10.5** Burning of wood and recharging of mobile battery

#### Reversible Reactions

A reversible reaction is a reaction in which the products can be converted back to the reactants. Represented by a double arrow.

**General scheme:**
```
AB ⇌ A + B
```

*Example:* Decomposition of phosphorous pentachloride.
```
PCl₅(g) ⇌ PCl₃(g) + Cl₂(g)
```

> Initially, the forward reaction proceeds faster than the backward reaction. After some time, the speed of both reactions become equal.

#### Irreversible Reactions

The reaction that cannot be reversed is called **irreversible reaction**. The irreversible reactions are unidirectional, i.e., they take place only in the forward direction.

**Example:** The combustion of coal into carbon dioxide and water.

$$\text{C}_{(s)} + \text{O}_{2(g)} \rightarrow \text{CO}_{2(g)} + \text{Heat}$$

In this reaction, solid coal burns with oxygen and gets converted into carbon dioxide gas. As the product is a gas, as soon as it is formed it escapes out of the reaction container. It is extremely hard to decompose a gas into a solid. Thus, the backward reaction is not possible in this case.

### Table 10.2: Differences between reversible and irreversible reactions

| REVERSIBLE REACTION | IRREVERSIBLE REACTION |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| It can be reversed under suitable conditions | It cannot be reversed |
| Both forward and backward reactions take place simultaneously | It is unidirectional. It proceeds only in forward direction |
| It attains equilibrium | Equilibrium is not attained |
| The reactants cannot be converted completely into products | The reactants can be completely converted into products |
| It is relatively slow | It is fast |

---

## 10.2 RATE OF A CHEMICAL REACTION

**Definition:** "Rate of a reaction is the change in the amount or concentration of any one of the reactants or products per unit time."

For reaction: A → B
```
Rate = -d[A]/dt = +d[B]/dt
```

### 10.2.1 Factors influencing the rate of a reaction

1. **Nature of the reactants**
2. **Concentration of the reactants**
3. **Temperature**
4. **Catalyst**
5. **Pressure**
6. **Surface area of the reactants**

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Nature of reactants | Stronger acids react faster (e.g., HCl vs CH₃COOH with Na) |
| Concentration | Higher concentration = faster reaction |
| Temperature | Higher temperature = faster reaction |
| Catalyst | Increases reaction rate without being consumed |
| Pressure | Increasing pressure (for gases) increases rate |
| Surface area | Powdered form reacts more readily than solid chunks |

*Example:* Manganese dioxide as catalyst for potassium chlorate decomposition.

---

## 10.3 STATE OF EQUILIBRIUM

In a reversible reaction, both forward and backward reactions take place simultaneously. When the rate of the forward reaction becomes equal to the rate of backward reaction, then no more product is formed. This stage is called **'equilibrium state'**.

**Chemical Equilibrium:** It is state of a reversible chemical reaction in which no change in the amount of the reactants and products takes place.

At equilibrium:
$$\text{Rate of forward reaction = Rate of backward reaction}$$

*Example:*
```
CaCO₃(s) ⇌ CaO(s) + CO₂(g)
```

**Physical Equilibrium:** When water kept in closed vessel evaporates, it forms water vapour. At equilibrium:
```
H₂O(l) ⇌ H₂O(g)
```

### Characteristics of equilibrium

- In a chemical equilibrium, the rates of the forward and backward reactions are equal.
- The observable properties such as pressure, concentration, colour, density, viscosity etc., of the system remain unchanged with time.
- The chemical equilibrium is a **dynamic equilibrium**, because both the forward and backward reactions continue to occur even though it appears static externally.
- In physical equilibrium, the volume of all the phases remain constant.

**DO YOU KNOW?** Aerated soft drinks contain dissolved carbon dioxide in equilibrium with gaseous CO₂. When you open the bottle, the gaseous CO₂ can escape, so the dissolved CO₂ begins to undissolve back to the gas phase. That's why if you leave it open long enough, it will go 'flat'.

---

## 10.4 IONIC PRODUCT OF WATER

Self-ionisation of water:
```
H₂O(l) + H₂O(l) ⇌ H₃O⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq)
```

**Ionic product of water (Kw):**
```
Kw = [H₃O⁺][OH⁻] = [H⁺][OH⁻]
```

Unit: mol² dm⁻⁶

At 25°C: **Kw = 1.00 × 10⁻¹⁴**

---

## 10.5 pH SCALE

pH scale is a scale for measuring the hydrogen ion concentration in a solution. The 'p' in pH stands for 'Potenz' in German meaning 'power'. Devised by Sorensen in 1909.

**pH scale:** 0 to 14

| Solution Type | pH Range |
|--------------|----------|
| Acids | pH < 7 |
| Neutral | pH = 7 |
| Bases | pH > 7 |

**Formula:**
```
pH = -log₁₀[H⁺]
```

### Common pH Values

| Common Acids | pH | Common Bases | pH |
|-------------|-----|-------------|-----|
| HCl (4%) | 0 | Blood plasma | 7.4 |
| Stomach acid | 1 | Egg white | 8 |
| Lemon juice | 2 | Seawater | 8 |
| Vinegar | 3 | Baking soda | 9 |
| Oranges | 3.5 | Antacids | 10 |
| Soda, grapes | 4 | Ammonia water | 11 |
| Sour milk | 4.5 | Lime water | 12 |
| Fresh milk | 5 | Drain cleaner | 13 |
| Human saliva | 6-8 | Caustic soda 4% (NaOH) | 14 |
| Pure water | 7 | Milk of magnesia | 10 |
| Tomato juice | 4.2 | Coffee | 5.6 |

## 10.6 ROLE OF pH IN EVERYDAY LIFE

### Are plants and animals pH sensitive?

Our body works within the pH range of **7.0 to 7.8**. Living organisms can survive only in a narrow range of pH change.

- **pH of blood:** 7.35 to 7.45 (ideal: 7.4)

### pH in our digestive system

- Stomach produces hydrochloric acid (pH ≈ 2.0)
- Helps in digestion without harming the stomach
- Indigestion causes excess acid → pain and irritation

### pH changes as the cause of tooth decay

- pH of saliva: 6.5 to 7.5
- When pH falls below 5.5, enamel (calcium phosphate) gets weathered
- Toothpastes (basic) neutralize excess acid

### pH of soil

| Crop | Soil pH |
|------|---------|
| Citrus fruits | Slightly alkaline |
| Rice | Acidic |
| Sugarcane | Neutral |

### pH of rain water

- Normal rain water pH ≈ 7 (neutral)
- If polluted with SOₓ, NOₓ gases → pH < 7 (**acid rain**)
- Acid rain lowers pH of river water, affecting aquatic life

## 10.7 pH CALCULATION

**pH formula:**
```
pH = -log₁₀[H⁺]
```

**pOH formula:**
```
pOH = -log₁₀[OH⁻]
```

**Relationship:**
```
pH + pOH = 14 (at 25°C)
```

### Example Problems

**Example 1:** Calculate the pH of 0.01 M HNO₃
```
[H⁺] = 0.01 = 1 × 10⁻²
pH = -log₁₀(10⁻²) = 2
```

**Example 2:** Calculate the pH of 0.001 M HCl
```
[H⁺] = 1 × 10⁻³
pH = -log₁₀(10⁻³) = 3
```

**Example 3:** Calculate the pH of 1 × 10⁻⁴ M NaOH
```
[OH⁻] = 1 × 10⁻⁴
pOH = -log₁₀(10⁻⁴) = 4
pH = 14 - 4 = 10
```

---

## 10.8 PROBLEMS

**Example 4:** Calculate the pH of a solution in which [H⁺] = 1.0 × 10⁻⁸ mol litre⁻¹
```
pH = -log₁₀(10⁻⁸) = 8
```

**Example 5:** If pH = 4.5, what is pOH?
```
pOH = 14 - 4.5 = 9.5
```

---
