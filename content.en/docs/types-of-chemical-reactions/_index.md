## INTRODUCTION

As you know from your earlier studies, a chemical reaction involves breaking of old chemical bonds and formation of new chemical bonds. This change may happen spontaneously or it may be facilitated by external forces or energy. Chemistry is all about chemical reactions. In your day to day life, you could observe many chemical reactions. A clear understanding of these reactions is essential in order to manipulate them for the sake of human life and environment.

**Key questions:**
- You need energy to play, walk, run or to perform various physical activities. Where do you get the energy from?
- How do plants grow and get their food?
- How does a car move using fuel?
- Why does iron rust on its exposure to water or air?

**Answers:**
- You get energy from the digestion of the food you eat.
- Plants grow by absorbing nutrients from the Earth and get their food by photosynthesis.
- The combustion of a fuel makes the car to move.
- Oxidation of iron causes rusting.

All these processes are chemical changes i.e. the materials, which undergo changes are converted into some other new materials.

## What happens during a chemical reaction?

- In a chemical reaction, the atoms of the reacting molecules or elements are rearranged to form new molecules.
- Old chemical bonds between atoms are broken and new chemical bonds are formed.
- Bond breaking absorbs energy whereas bond formation releases energy.

## How are chemical reactions represented?

When methane reacts with oxygen, it forms carbon dioxide and water. It can be written as a word equation as shown below:

**Methane + Oxygen → Carbon dioxide + Water**

But, this equation does not give the chemical composition of the reactants and products. So, to learn the characteristics of a chemical reaction, it is represented by a chemical equation. In the chemical equation, the chemicals of the reaction are represented by their chemical formulas. The compounds or elements, which undergo reactions (reactants) are shown to the left of an arrow and the compounds formed (products) are shown to the right of the arrow. The arrow indicates the direction of the reaction.

$$\text{CH}_4 + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow \text{CO}_2 + \text{H}_2\text{O}$$

But, this is also an incomplete chemical equation. Because, the law of conservation of matter states that matter cannot be created or destroyed. You cannot create new atoms by a chemical reaction. In contrast, they are rearranged in different ways by a chemical reaction to form a new compound. So, in a chemical equation, the number of atoms of the reactants and that of the products must be equal.

On balancing the number of atoms, the following equation can be obtained:

$$\text{CH}_4 + 2\text{O}_2 \rightarrow \text{CO}_2 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O}$$

Further, the chemical equation provides information on the physical state of the substances and the conditions under which the reaction takes place.

$$\text{CH}_{4(g)} + 2\text{O}_{2(g)} \rightarrow \text{CO}_{2(g)} + 2\text{H}_2\text{O}_{(g)}$$

**A balanced chemical equation** is the simplified representation of a chemical reaction which describes the chemical composition, physical state of the reactants and the products, and the reaction conditions.

## 10.1 TYPES OF CHEMICAL REACTIONS

### Classification based on the nature of rearrangements of atoms

#### (a) Combination reactions

A combination reaction is a reaction in which two or more reactants combine to form a compound. It is otherwise called 'synthesis reaction' or 'composition reaction'.

**General scheme:**
```
A + B → AB
```

**Example:** Hydrogen gas combines with chlorine gas to form hydrogen chloride gas.

$$\text{H}_{2(g)} + \text{Cl}_{2(g)} \rightarrow 2\text{HCl}_{(g)}$$

Depending on the chemical nature of the reactants, there are three classes of combination reactions:

#### 1. Element + Element → Compound

In this type of combination reaction, two elements react with one other to form a compound. The reaction may take place between a metal and a non-metal or two non-metals.

**Example 1:** When solid sulphur reacts with oxygen, it produces sulphur dioxide. Here both the reactants are non-metals.

$$\text{S}_{(s)} + \text{O}_{2(g)} \rightarrow \text{SO}_{2(g)}$$

**Example 2:** Sodium, a silvery-white metal, combines with chlorine, a pale yellow green gas, to form sodium chloride, an edible compound. Here one of the reactants is a metal (sodium) and the other (chlorine) is a nonmetal.

$$2\text{Na}_{(s)} + \text{Cl}_{2(g)} \rightarrow 2\text{NaCl}_{(s)}$$

> **Test Yourself:**
> Identify the possible combination reactions between the metals and non-metals given in the following table and write their balanced chemical equations:
> 
> | Metals | Non-metals |
> |:---|:---|
> | Na, K, Cs, Ca | F, Cl, Br, I |

#### 2. Compound + Element → Compound

In this case, a compound reacts with an element to form a new compound.

**Example:** Phosphorous trichloride reacts with chlorine gas and forms phosphorous pentachloride.

$$\text{PCl}_{3(l)} + \text{Cl}_{2(g)} \rightarrow \text{PCl}_{5(s)}$$

#### 3. Compound + Compound → Compound

It is a reaction between two compounds to form a new compound.

**Example:** Silicon dioxide reacts with calcium oxide to form calcium silicate.

$$\text{SiO}_{2(s)} + \text{CaO}_{(s)} \rightarrow \text{CaSiO}_{3(s)}$$

> Most of the combination reactions are **exothermic** in nature. Because, they involve the formation of new bonds, which releases a huge amount of energy in the form of heat.

---

#### (b) Decomposition reactions

In a decomposition reaction, a single compound splits into two or more simpler substances under suitable conditions. It is the opposite of the combination reaction.

**General scheme:**
```
AB → A + B
```

**Three main classes:**

**(i) Thermal Decomposition Reactions**

In this type of reaction, the reactant is decomposed by applying heat. For example, on heating mercury (II) oxide is decomposed into mercury metal and oxygen gas. As the molecule is dissociated by the absorption of heat, it is otherwise called 'Thermolysis'.

$$2\text{HgO}_{(s)} \xrightarrow{\text{Heat}} 2\text{Hg}_{(l)} + \text{O}_{2(g)}$$

Similarly, when calcium carbonate is heated, it breaks down into calcium oxide and carbon dioxide.

$$\text{CaCO}_{3(s)} \xrightarrow{\text{Heat}} \text{CaO}_{(s)} + \text{CO}_{2(g)}$$

In thermal decomposition reaction, heat is supplied to break the bonds. Such reactions, in which heat is absorbed, are called **'Endothermic reactions'**.

**(ii) Electrolytic Decomposition Reactions**

Electrical energy is used to bring about the reaction (Electrolysis).

**Example:** Decomposition of sodium chloride occurs on passing electric current through its aqueous solution. Sodium chloride decomposes into metallic sodium and chlorine gas. This process is termed as **'Electrolysis'**.

$$2\text{NaCl}_{(aq)} \xrightarrow{\text{Electricity}} 2\text{Na}_{(s)} + \text{Cl}_{2(g)}$$

#### (iii) Photo Decomposition Reactions

Light is another form of energy, which facilitates some of the decomposition reactions.

**Example:** When silver bromide is exposed to light, it breaks down into silver metal and bromine gas. As the decomposition is caused by light, this kind of reaction is also called **'Photolysis'**.

$$2\text{AgBr}_{(s)} \xrightarrow{\text{light}} 2\text{Ag}_{(s)} + \text{Br}_{2(g)}$$

The yellow coloured silver bromide turns into grey coloured silver metal.

> **DO YOU KNOW?**
> 
> A solution of slaked lime is used for white washing walls. Calcium hydroxide reacts slowly with the carbon dioxide in air to form a thin layer of calcium carbonate on the walls. Calcium carbonate is formed after two to three days of white washing and gives a shiny finish to the walls. It is interesting to note that the chemical formula for marble is also CaCO₃.
> 
> $$\text{Ca(OH)}_{2(aq)} + \text{CO}_{2(g)} \rightarrow \text{CaCO}_{3(s)} + \text{H}_2\text{O}_{(l)}$$

---

#### (c) Single Displacement Reactions

It is a reaction between an element and a compound. When they react, one of the elements of the compound-reactant is replaced by the element-reactant.

**General schematic:** A + BC → AC + B

'A' displaces element 'B' from the compound 'BC' and hence a single displacement reaction occurs.

**Example 1:** If zinc metal is placed in hydrochloric acid, hydrogen gas is evolved. Here, hydrogen is displaced by zinc metal and zinc chloride is formed.

$$\text{Zn}_{(s)} + 2\text{HCl}_{(aq)} \rightarrow \text{ZnCl}_{2(aq)} + \text{H}_{2(g)}$$

**Example 2:** If an iron nail is placed in an aqueous solution of copper (II) sulphate, the iron displaces copper from its aqueous solution and the so formed copper deposits over the iron nail.

$$\text{Fe}_{(s)} + \text{CuSO}_{4(aq)} \rightarrow \text{FeSO}_{4(aq)} + \text{Cu}_{(s)}$$

#### Activity Series

In displacement reactions, the activity of the elements and their relative position in the periodic table are the key factors to determine the feasibility of the reactions. More active elements readily displace less active elements from their aqueous solution.

**The activity series of some elements:**

| Mnemonic | Element |
|:---|:---|
| Please | Potassium (K) |
| Send | Sodium (Na) |
| Lions | Lithium (Li) |
| Cats | Calcium (Ca) |
| Monkeys | Magnesium (Mg) |
| And | Aluminium (Al) |
| Zebras | Zinc (Zn) |
| Into | Iron (Fe) |
| Lovely | Lead (Pb) |
| Hot | Hydrogen (H) |
| Countries | Copper (Cu) |
| Signed | Silver (Ag) |
| General | Gold (Au) |
| Penguin | Platinum (Pt) |

---

#### (d) Double Displacement Reactions

When two compounds react, if their ions are interchanged, then the reaction is called double displacement reaction (Metathesis Reaction).

**General scheme:**
```
AB + CD → AD + CB
```

**Two major classes:**

**(i) Precipitation Reactions**

When aqueous solutions of two compounds are mixed, if they react to form an insoluble compound and a soluble compound.

**Example:** When the clear aqueous solutions of potassium iodide and lead (II) nitrate are mixed, a double displacement reaction takes place between them.

$$\text{Pb(NO}_3)_{2(aq)} + 2\text{KI}_{(aq)} \rightarrow \text{PbI}_{2(s)}\downarrow + 2\text{KNO}_{3(aq)}$$

Potassium and lead displace or replace one other and form a yellow precipitate of lead (II) iodide.

#### (ii) Neutralization Reactions

It is another type of displacement reaction in which the acid reacts with the base to form a salt and water. It is called **'neutralization reaction'** as both acid and base neutralize each other.

**General:** Acid + Base → Salt + Water

**Example 1:** Reaction of sodium hydroxide with hydrochloric acid is a typical neutralization reaction. Here, sodium replaces hydrogen from hydrochloric acid forming sodium chloride, a neutral soluble salt.

$$\text{NaOH}_{(aq)} + \text{HCl}_{(aq)} \rightarrow \text{NaCl}_{(aq)} + \text{H}_2\text{O}_{(l)}$$

**Example 2:** When ammonium hydroxide reacts with nitric acid, it forms ammonium nitrate and water.

$$\text{HNO}_{3(aq)} + \text{NH}_4\text{OH}_{(aq)} \rightarrow \text{NH}_4\text{NO}_{3(aq)} + \text{H}_2\text{O}_{(l)}$$

---

### (e) Combustion Reactions

A **combustion reaction** is one in which the reactant rapidly combines with oxygen to form one or more oxides and energy (heat). So in combustion reactions, one of the reactants must be oxygen. Combustion reactions are majorly used as heat energy sources in many of our day to day activities.

**Example:** LPG is a mixture of hydrocarbon gases like propane, butane, propylene, etc. All these hydrocarbons burn with oxygen to form carbon dioxide and water.

$$\text{C}_3\text{H}_{8(g)} + 5\text{O}_{2(g)} \rightarrow 3\text{CO}_{2(g)} + 4\text{H}_2\text{O}_{(l)} + \text{Heat}$$

Since heat is evolved, it is an **exothermic reaction**. As oxygen is added, it is also an oxidation. So combustion may be called as an **exothermic oxidation**. If a flame is formed, then it is called **burning**.

> **Conceptual Thought:** All combustion reactions are oxidations but all oxidations are not combustions.

### Table 10.1: Differences between combination and decomposition reactions

| COMBINATION REACTIONS | DECOMPOSITION REACTIONS |
|----------------------|------------------------|
| One or more reactants combine to form a single product | A single reactant is decomposed to form one or more products |
| Energy is released | Energy is absorbed |
| Elements or compounds may be the reactants | Single compound is the reactant |

---

### 10.1.2 Classification based on the direction of the reaction

#### Reversible Reactions

A reversible reaction is a reaction in which the products can be converted back to the reactants. Represented by a double arrow.

**General:** AB ⇌ A + B

**Example:** Decomposition of phosphorous pentachloride into phosphorous trichloride and chlorine.

$$\text{PCl}_{5(g)} \rightleftharpoons \text{PCl}_{3(g)} + \text{Cl}_{2(g)}$$

The forward reaction is the decomposition of PCl₅ and the backward reaction is the combination of PCl₃ and Cl₂. Initially, the forward reaction proceeds faster than the backward reaction. After sometimes, the speed of both the reactions become equal. So, PCl₅ cannot be completely converted into the products as the reaction is reversed.

> **MORE TO KNOW**
> 
> If hydrogen peroxide is poured on a wound, it decomposes into water and oxygen. The gaseous oxygen bubbles away as it is formed and thus prevent the formation of H₂O₂.
> 
> $$2\text{H}_2\text{O}_{2(aq)} \rightleftharpoons 2\text{H}_2\text{O}_{(l)} + \text{O}_{2(g)}$$
> 
> Thus, more amount of products can be obtained in a reversible reaction by the periodical removal of one of the products or the periodical addition of the reactants.

### Irreversible Reactions

The reaction that cannot be reversed is called **irreversible reaction**. The irreversible reactions are unidirectional, i.e., they take place only in the forward direction.

**Example:** The combustion of coal into carbon dioxide and water.

$$\text{C}_{(s)} + \text{O}_{2(g)} \rightarrow \text{CO}_{2(g)} + \text{Heat}$$

In this reaction, solid coal burns with oxygen and gets converted into carbon dioxide gas. As the product is a gas, as soon as it is formed it escapes out of the reaction container. It is extremely hard to decompose a gas into a solid. Thus, the backward reaction is not possible in this case.

### Table 10.2: Differences between reversible and irreversible reactions

| REVERSIBLE REACTION | IRREVERSIBLE REACTION |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| It can be reversed under suitable conditions | It cannot be reversed |
| Both forward and backward reactions take place simultaneously | It is unidirectional. It proceeds only in forward direction |
| It attains equilibrium | Equilibrium is not attained |
| The reactants cannot be converted completely into products | The reactants can be completely converted into products |
| It is relatively slow | It is fast |

## 10.2 RATE OF A CHEMICAL REACTION

**Rate of a reaction** is the change in the amount or concentration of any one of the reactants or products per unit time.

Consider the following reaction: A → B

The rate of this reaction is given by:

$$\text{Rate} = -\frac{d[A]}{dt} = +\frac{d[B]}{dt}$$

Where,
- [A] – Concentration of A
- [B] – Concentration of B

The negative sign indicates the decrease in the concentration of A with time.
The positive sign indicates the increase in the concentration of B with time.

### Why is reaction rate important?

Faster the reaction, more will be the amount of the product in a specified time. So, the rate of a reaction is important for a chemist for designing a process to get a good yield of a product. Rate of reaction is also important for a food processor who hopes to slow down the reactions that cause food to spoil.

### 10.2.1 Factors influencing the rate of a reaction

1. **Nature of the reactants**
2. **Concentration of the reactants**
3. **Temperature**
4. **Catalyst**
5. **Pressure**
6. **Surface area of the reactants**

#### (i) Nature of the reactants

The reaction of sodium with hydrochloric acid is faster than that with acetic acid. Hydrochloric acid is a stronger acid than acetic acid and thus more reactive.

$$2\text{Na}_{(s)} + 2\text{HCl}_{(aq)} \rightarrow 2\text{NaCl}_{(aq)} + \text{H}_{2(g)} \text{ (fast)}$$
$$2\text{Na}_{(s)} + 2\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}_{(aq)} \rightarrow 2\text{CH}_3\text{COONa}_{(aq)} + \text{H}_{2(g)} \text{ (slow)}$$

#### (ii) Concentration of the reactants

More the concentration, more particles per volume exist in it and hence faster the reaction. Granulated zinc reacts faster with 2M hydrochloric acid than 1M hydrochloric acid.

#### (iii) Temperature

Most of the reactions go faster at higher temperature. Because adding heat to the reactants provides energy to break more bonds and thus speed up the reaction.

Food kept at room temperature spoils faster than that kept in the refrigerator.

#### (iv) Pressure

If the reactants are gases, increasing their pressure increases the reaction rate. This is because, on increasing the pressure the reacting particles come closer and collide frequently.

#### (v) Catalyst

A **catalyst** is a substance which increases the reaction rate without being consumed in the reaction.

**Example:** On heating potassium chlorate, it decomposes into potassium chloride and oxygen gas, but at a slower rate. If manganese dioxide is added, it increases the reaction rate.

#### (vi) Surface area of the reactants

When solid reactants are involved in a reaction, their powdered form reacts more readily. For example, powdered calcium carbonate reacts more readily with hydrochloric acid than marble chips. Because, powdering of the reactants increases the surface area.

---

## 10.3 STATE OF EQUILIBRIUM

In a reversible reaction, both forward and backward reactions take place simultaneously. When the rate of the forward reaction becomes equal to the rate of backward reaction, then no more product is formed. This stage is called **'equilibrium state'**.

**Chemical Equilibrium:** It is state of a reversible chemical reaction in which no change in the amount of the reactants and products takes place.

At equilibrium:
$$\text{Rate of forward reaction = Rate of backward reaction}$$

*Example:*
```
CaCO₃(s) ⇌ CaO(s) + CO₂(g)
```

$$\text{H}_2\text{O}_{(l)} \rightleftharpoons \text{H}_2\text{O}_{(g)}$$

### Characteristics of equilibrium

- In a chemical equilibrium, the rates of the forward and backward reactions are equal.
- The observable properties such as pressure, concentration, colour, density, viscosity etc., of the system remain unchanged with time.
- The chemical equilibrium is a **dynamic equilibrium**, because both the forward and backward reactions continue to occur.
- In physical equilibrium, the volume of all the phases remain constant.

## 10.4 IONIC PRODUCT OF WATER

Although pure water is often considered as a non-conductor of electricity, precise measurements show that it conducts electricity to a little extent. This conductivity of water has resulted from the **self-ionisation of water**.

Self-ionisation or auto ionisation is a reaction in which two like molecules react to give ions. In the process of ionisation of water, a proton from one water molecule is transferred to another water molecule leaving behind an OH⁻ ion.

$$2\text{H}_2\text{O}_{(l)} \rightleftharpoons \text{H}_3\text{O}^+_{(aq)} + \text{OH}^-_{(aq)}$$

The product of the concentration of the hydronium ion and the hydroxyl ion is called **'ionic product of water'**. It is denoted as **'Kw'**.

$$\text{K}_w = [\text{H}_3\text{O}^+][\text{OH}^-]$$

or simply:

$$\text{K}_w = [\text{H}^+][\text{OH}^-]$$

Its unit is mol² dm⁻⁶. At 25°C, its value is **1.00 × 10⁻¹⁴**.

---

## 10.5 pH SCALE

**pH scale** is a scale for measuring the hydrogen ion concentration in a solution. The 'p' in pH stands for 'Potenz' in German meaning 'power'. pH notation was devised by the Danish biochemist Sorensen in 1909.

pH scale is a set of numbers from 0 to 14 which is used to indicate whether a solution is acidic, basic or neutral.

- **Acids** have pH less than 7
- **Bases** have pH greater than 7
- **A neutral solution** has pH equal to 7

The pH is the negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion concentration:

$$\text{pH} = -\log_{10}[\text{H}^+]$$

| Common Acids | pH | Common Bases | pH |
|-------------|-----|-------------|-----|
| HCl (4%) | 0 | Blood plasma | 7.4 |
| Stomach acid | 1 | Egg white | 8 |
| Lemon juice | 2 | Seawater | 8 |
| Vinegar | 3 | Baking soda | 9 |
| Oranges | 3.5 | Antacids | 10 |
| Soda, grapes | 4 | Ammonia water | 11 |
| Sour milk | 4.5 | Lime water | 12 |
| Fresh milk | 5 | Drain cleaner | 13 |
| Human saliva | 6-8 | Caustic soda 4% (NaOH) | 14 |
| Pure water | 7 | Milk of magnesia | 10 |
| Tomato juice | 4.2 | Coffee | 5.6 |

## 10.6 ROLE OF pH IN EVERYDAY LIFE

### Are plants and animals pH sensitive?

Our body works within the pH range of **7.0 to 7.8**. Living organisms can survive only in a narrow range of pH change.

- **pH of blood:** 7.35 to 7.45 (ideal: 7.4)

### pH in our digestive system

- Stomach produces hydrochloric acid (pH ≈ 2.0)
- Helps in digestion without harming the stomach
- Indigestion causes excess acid → pain and irritation

### pH changes as the cause of tooth decay

- pH of saliva: 6.5 to 7.5
- When pH falls below 5.5, enamel (calcium phosphate) gets weathered
- Toothpastes (basic) neutralize excess acid

### pH of soil

| Crop | Soil pH |
|------|---------|
| Citrus fruits | Slightly alkaline |
| Rice | Acidic |
| Sugarcane | Neutral |

### pH of rain water

- Normal rain water pH ≈ 7 (neutral)
- If polluted with SOₓ, NOₓ gases → pH < 7 (**acid rain**)
- Acid rain lowers pH of river water, affecting aquatic life

---

## 10.7 pH CALCULATION

The pH is the negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion concentration:

$$\text{pH} = -\log_{10}[\text{H}^+]$$

**Example:** Calculate the pH of 0.01M HNO₃?

**Solution:**
$$[\text{H}^+] = 0.01$$
$$\text{pH} = -\log_{10}[0.01] = -\log_{10}[1 \times 10^{-2}] = 0 + 2 = 2$$

### pOH

The **pOH** is the negative logarithm of the hydroxyl ion concentration:

$$\text{pOH} = -\log_{10}[\text{OH}^-]$$

### Relationship between pH and pOH

$$\text{pH} + \text{pOH} = 14$$

If either the pH or the pOH of a solution is known, the other value can be calculated.

---

## 10.8 PROBLEMS

**Example 1:** Calculate the pH of 0.001 molar solution of HCl.

**Solution:** HCl is a strong acid and is completely dissociated.
$$[\text{H}^+] = 1 \times 10^{-3} \text{ mol litre}^{-1}$$
$$\text{pH} = -\log_{10}[10^{-3}] = 3$$

**Example 2:** What would be the pH of an aqueous solution of sulphuric acid which is 5 × 10⁻⁵ mol litre⁻¹ in concentration.

**Solution:** Each mole of sulphuric acid gives two mole of H⁺ ions.
$$[\text{H}^+] = 2 \times 5 \times 10^{-5} = 1.0 \times 10^{-4} \text{ mol litre}^{-1}$$
$$\text{pH} = -\log_{10}[10^{-4}] = 4$$

**Example 3:** Calculate the pH of 1 × 10⁻⁴ molar solution of NaOH.

**Solution:** 
$$[\text{OH}^-] = 1 \times 10^{-4} \text{ mol litre}^{-1}$$
$$\text{pOH} = -\log_{10}[10^{-4}] = 4$$
$$\text{pH} = 14 - 4 = 10$$

**Example 4:** Calculate the pH of a solution in which the concentration of the hydrogen ions is 1.0 × 10⁻⁸ mol litre⁻¹.

**Solution:**
$$\text{pH} = -\log_{10}[1.0 \times 10^{-8}] = 8$$

**Example 5:** If the pH of a solution is 4.5, what is its pOH?

**Solution:**
$$\text{pOH} = 14 - 4.5 = 9.5$$

| $\text{ZnCO}_{3(s)} \xrightarrow{\text{Heat}} \text{ZnO}_{(s)} + \text{CO}_{2(g)}$ | Neutralisation |
| $\text{C}_2\text{H}_{4(g)} + 4\text{O}_{2(g)} \rightarrow 2\text{CO}_{2(g)} + 2\text{H}_2\text{O}_{(g)} + \text{Heat}$ | Thermal decomposition |

### IV. True or False

1. Silver metal can displace hydrogen gas from nitric acid. **FALSE** (Silver is below hydrogen in activity series)
2. The pH of rain water containing dissolved gases like SO₃, CO₂, NO₂ will be less than 7. **TRUE**
3. At the equilibrium of a reversible reaction, the concentration of the reactants and the products will be equal. **FALSE** (Rates are equal, not necessarily concentrations)
4. Periodical removal of one of the products of a reversible reaction increases the yield. **TRUE**
5. On dipping a pH paper in a solution, it turns into yellow. Then the solution is basic. **FALSE** (Yellow indicates acidic, pH ~6)

### V. Short answer questions

1. **White precipitate reaction:**
   ```
   KCl(aq) + AgNO₃(aq) → AgCl(s)↓ + KNO₃(aq)
   ```

2. **Why reaction rate increases with temperature:**
   Adding heat provides energy to break more bonds and thus speeds up the reaction.

3. **Combination reaction definition:** A reaction in which two or more reactants combine to form a compound.
   *Example:* Burning of coal: C + O₂ → CO₂ + Heat (exothermic)

4. **Reversible vs Irreversible reactions:**

| Reversible | Irreversible |
|------------|--------------|
| Can be reversed | Cannot be reversed |
| Both directions occur | Unidirectional |
| Attains equilibrium | No equilibrium |
| Relatively slow | Fast |

### VI. Answer in detail

1. **Thermolysis reactions:** Decomposition reactions caused by heat/thermal energy. Heat is absorbed (endothermic). Examples: 2HgO → 2Hg + O₂; CaCO₃ → CaO + CO₂

2. **Types of double displacement reactions:**
   - Precipitation: Forms insoluble product (PbI₂ from KI + Pb(NO₃)₂)
   - Neutralisation: Acid + Base → Salt + Water

3. **Factors influencing rate:** Nature of reactants, concentration, temperature, catalyst, pressure, surface area

4. **Role of pH in everyday life:** Digestive system, tooth decay prevention, soil pH for agriculture, blood pH maintenance, acid rain effects

5. **Chemical equilibrium:** State where forward and backward reaction rates are equal. Characteristics: dynamic nature, constant observable properties, closed system required.

### VII. HOT questions

1. **Compound A:** Calcium carbonate (CaCO₃)
   - **B:** Calcium oxide (CaO)
   - **C:** Carbon dioxide (CO₂)

2. **Nickel spatula in copper sulphate:** Yes, because nickel is above copper in the activity series and can displace it.
