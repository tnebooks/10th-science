**Introduction**

Plants exhibits varying degrees of organization. Atoms are organized into molecules, molecules into organelles, organelles into cells, cells into tissues and tissues into organs. The first account of internal structure of plants was published by English Physician **Nehemiah Grew**. He is known as **Father of Plant Anatomy**. Plant anatomy (Gk _Ana_ = as under; _Temnein_ = to cut) is the study of internal structure of plants. You have already studied the different kinds of tissues in standard IX. In this lesson, you will study about the internal structure of plant tissues, process of photosynthesis and respiration.

## Tissues

Tissues are the group of cells that are similar or dissimilar in structure and origin, but perform similar function. Plant tissues can be broadly classified into two, based on their ability to divide. They are

i) Meristamatic tissue 

ii) Permanent tissue.

## Tissue system

Sachs (1875) classified tissue system in plants into three types

i) Dermal or Epidermal tissue system 

ii) Ground tissue system 

iii) Vascular tissue system

The functions of these tissues are given in Table 12.1.

### Dermal or Epidermal Tissue System

It consists of epidermis, stomata and epidermal outgrowths. Epidermis is the outer most layer. It has many minute pores called stomata.


**Table 12.1** Tissue system and its functions **Tissue System Components Functions**

| Tissue System |C omponents |Functions |
|------|------|------|
| Dermal Tissue System |Epidermis and Periderm(in older stems and roots) |- Protection- Prevention of water loss |
| Ground Tissue System |Parenchyma tissueCollenchyma tissueSclerenchyma tissue |- Photosynthesis- Food storage- Regeneration- Support- Protection |
| Vascular Tissue System |Vascular tissues- Xylem tissue- Phloem tissue |- Transport of water and minerals- Transport of food |
  

Cuticle is present on the outer wall of epidermis to check evaporation of water. Trichomes and root hairs are the epidermal outgrowths.

**Functions:** 

i) Epidermis protects the inner tissues. 

ii) Stomata helps in transpiration. 

iii) Root hairs help in absorption of water and minerals.

### Ground Tissue System

It includes all the tissues of the plant body except epidermal and vascular tissues like 

(i) Cortex 

(ii) Endodermis 

(iii) Pericycle 

(iv) Pith

### Vascular Tissue System


It consists of xylem and phloem tissues. They are present in the form of bundles called vascular bundles. Xylem conducts water and minerals to different parts of the plant. Phloem conducts food materials to different parts of the plant.

There are three different types of vascular bundles namely (i) Radial (ii) Conjoint (iii) Concentric 

**(i) Radial Bundles**

Xylem and phloem are present in different radii alternating with each other. e.g. roots

**(ii) Conjoint bundles** 

Xylem and phloem lie on the same radius. There are two types of conjoint bundles.

**a) Collateral** 

Xylem lies towards the centre and phloem lies towards the periphery. When cambium is present in collateral bundles, it is called open. e.g. dicot stem and collateral bundle without cambium is called closed. e.g. monocot stem.

**b) Bicollateral** 

In this type of bundle, the phloem is present on both outer and inner side of xylem. e.g. _Cucurbita_

**(iii) Concentric Bundles** 

Vascular bundle in which xylem completely surrounds the phloem or viceversa is called concentric vascular bundle. It is of two types:

1\. **Amphivasal:** Xylem surrounds phloem. e.g. _Dracaena_

2\. **Amphicribral:** Phloem surrounds xylem. e.g. Ferns

**Endarch:** Protoxylem lies towards the centre and metaxylem lies towards the periphery. e.g. stem.

**Exarch :** Protoxylem lies towards the periphery and metaxylem lies towards the centre. e.g. roots.

## Plant Physiology

### Plastids


Plastids are double membrane bound organelles found in plants and some algae. They are responsible for preparation and storage of food. There are three types of plastids.

Chloroplast - green coloured plastids 

Chromoplast - yellow, red, orange coloured

plastids Leucoplast - colourless plastids


### Structure of Chloroplast


Chloroplasts are green plastids containing green pigment called **chlorophyll**. Chloroplasts are oval shaped organelles having a diameter of 2-10 micrometer and a thickness of 1-2 micrometer.

![Alt Ultrastructure of Chloroplast](figure-12.8.png)

**Figure 12.8** Ultrastructure of Chloroplast

**1\. Envelope:** Chloroplast envelope has outer and inner membranes which is seperated by intermembrane space.

**2\. Stroma:** Matrix present inside to the membrane is called stroma. It contains DNA, 70 S ribosomes and other molecules required for protein synthesis.

**3\. Thylakoids: It consists of thylakoid** membrane that encloses thylakoid lumen. Photosynthetic pigments are present in thylakoids. Thylakoids forms a stack of disc **like structures** called a grana (singular- granum).

**4\. Grana: Thylakoids arranged in the form** of discs stacked one above the other called granum. Grana are inter connected by stroma lamella.

### Functions of Chloroplast


1\. Photosynthesis 2. Storage of starch 3. Synthesis of fatty acids 4. Storage of lipids 5. Formation of chloroplasts

### Photosynthesis

Photosynthesis (Photo = light; synthesis = to build) is a process by which autotrophic organisms like green plants, algae and chlorophyll containing bacteria utilize the energy from sunlight to synthesize their own food. In this process, carbon dioxide combines with water in the presence of sunlight and chlorophyll to form carbohydrates. During this process oxygen is released as a byproduct.

![Alt text](e1.png)

### Where does photosynthesis occur?

Photosynthesis occurs in all green parts of the plant especially in green leaves.

### Photosynthetic Pigments

Pigments involved in photosynthesis are called **Photosynthetic pigments.** Photosynthetic pigments are of two classes namely, the primary pigments and accessory pigments. Chlorophyll a is the **primary pigment** that traps solar energy and converts it into electrical and chemical energy. Thus it is called the reaction centre. Other pigments such as chlorophyll b and carotenoids are called **accessory pigments** as they pass on the absorbed energy to chlorophyll a (Chl.a) molecule. Reaction centre (Primary pigments) and harvesting centre (Accessary pigments) together form Pigment systems.

### Role of Sunlight in Photosynthesis


The entire process of photosynthesis takes place inside the chloroplast. The structure of chloroplast is such that the light dependent (**Light reaction**) and light independent (**Dark reaction) take place at different sites in the** organelle

**1\. Light dependent Reaction (Hill reaction \\ Light reaction)** This was discovered by Robin Hill (1939).

This reaction takes place in the presence of light energy in **thylakoid membranes** (grana) of the chloroplasts. Photosynthetic pigments absorb the light energy and convert it into chemical energy ATP and NADPH2. These products of light reaction move out from the thylakoid to the stroma of the chloroplast.

**More to Know**

| ATP |Adenosine Triphosphate |
|------|------|
| ADP |Adenosine Diphosphate |
| NAD |Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide |
| NADP |Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate |

A cell cannot get its energy directly from glucose. So in respiration the energy released from glucose is used to make ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate)

**2\. Light independent reactions (Dark reaction) (Biosynthetic phase)**

Dark reaction or biosynthetic pathway is takes place in **stroma**. During this reaction CO~2~ is reduced into carbohydrates with the help of light generated ATP and NADPH2. This is also called as **Calvin cycle** and is carried out in the absence of light. It is called    dark reaction.

In Calvin cycle the inputs are CO~2~ from the atmosphere and the ATP and NADPH2 produced from light reaction.

![Alt Overview of Hill and Calvin cycle](figure-12.9.png)

**Figure 12.9** Overview of Hill and Calvin cycle

Melvin Calvin, an American biochemist, discovered chemical pathway for photosynthesis. The cycle is named as Calvin cycle. He was awarded with Nobel Prize in the year 1961 for his discovery.

### Factors Affecting Photosynthesis


**a) Internal Factors**: 

i) Pigments ii) Leaf age iii) Accumulation of carbohydrates iv) Hormones

**b) External Factors**: 

i) Light ii) Carbon dioxide iii) Temperature iv) Water v) Mineral elements

**Info bit**

Artificial photosynthesis is a method for producing renewable energy by the use of sunlight. Indian scientist C.N.R. Rao who was conferred the Bharat Ratna (2013) is also working on similar technology of artificial photosynthesis to produce - Hydrogen fuel (renewable energy).

## Mitochondria

Mitochondria are filamentous or granular cytoplasmic organelles present in cells. The mitochondria were first discovered by Kolliker in 1857 as granular structures in striated muscles. Mitochondria (singular: mitochondrion) are organelles within eukaryotic cells that produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) which form the energy currency of the cell, for this reason, the mitochondria is referred to as the “**Power house of the cell**”. Mitochondria vary in size from 0.5 µm to 2.0 µm. Mitochondria contain 60-70% protein, 25-30% lipids, 5-7% RNA and small amount of DNA and minerals.

### Structure of Mitochondria 

Mitochondrial Membranes:

It consists two membranes called inner and outer membrane. Each membrane is 60-70 Å thick. Outer mitochondrial membrane is smooth and freely permeable to most small molecules. It contains enzymes, proteins and lipids. It has **porin molecules** (proteins) which form channels for passage of molecules through it.

![Alt Structure of Mitochondria](figure-12.10.png)

**Figure 12.10** Structure of Mitochondria


Inner mitochondrial membrane is semi permeable membrane and regulates the passage of materials into and out of the mitochondria. It is rich in enzymes and carrier proteins. It consists of 80% proteins and lipids.


**Cristae:** The inner mitochondrial membrane gives rise to finger like projections called cristae. These cristae increase the inner surface area (fold in inner membrane) of the mitochondria to hold variety of enzymes.

**Oxysomes:** The inner mitochondrial membrane bear minute regularly spaced tennis racket shaped particles known as oxysomes (F1 particle). They involve in ATP synthesis.

![Alt Structure of Oxysomes](figure-12.11.png)

**Figure 12.11** Structure of Oxysomes

**Mitochondrial matrix** - It is a complex mixture of proteins and lipids. Matrix contains enzymes for Krebs cycle, mitochondrial ribosomes(70 S), tRNAs and mitochondrial DNA.

### Functions of Mitochondria


- Mitochondria is the main organelle of cell respiration. They produce a large number of ATP molecules. So they are called as **power houses** **of the cell** or **ATP factory of the cell**.

- It helps the cells to maintain normal concentration of calcium ions.

- It regulates the metabolic activity of the cell.

## TYPES OF RESPIRATION

Respiration involves exchange of gases between the organism and the external environment. The plants obtain oxygen from their environment and release carbon dioxide and water vapour. This exchange of gases is known as **external respiration**. It is a physical process. Biochemical process occurs within cells where the food is oxidized to obtain energy, this is known as cellular respiration

### Aerobic respiration

Aerobic respiration is the type of celluar respiration in which organic food is completely oxidized with the help of oxygen into carbon dioxide, water and energy. It occurs in most plants and animals.

C~6~H~12~O~6~ + 6O~**2**~ → 6CO~2~ + 6H~2~O + ATP

**Stages of Aerobic respiration**

**a. Glycolysis** (Glucose splitting): It is the breakdown of one molecule of glucose (6 carbon) into two molecules of pyruvic acid (3 carbon). Glycolysis takes place in cytoplasm of the cell. It is the first step of both aerobic and anerobic respiration.

**b. Krebs Cycle: This cycle occurs in** mitochondria matrix. At the end of glycolysis, 2 molecules of pyruvic acid enter into mitochondria. The oxidation of pyruvic acid into CO~2~ and water takes place through this cycle. It is also called **Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle** (TCA).

**c. Electron Transport Chain: This is** accomplished through a system of electron carrier complex called **electron transport chain** (ETC) located on the inner membrane of the mitochondria. NADH~2~ and FADH~2~ molecules formed during glycolysis and Krebs cycle are oxidised to NAD^+^ and FAD^+^ to release the energy via electrons. The electrons, as they move through the system, release energy which is trapped by ADP to synthesize ATP. This is called **oxidative phosphorylation**. In this process, O2 the ultimate acceptor of electrons gets reduced to water.

### Anaerobic respiration

Anaerobic respiration takes place without oxygen. Glucose is converted into ethanol (Ethanol fermentation by yeast) or lactic acid (lactic acid fermentation by bacteria).

C~6~H~12~O~6~ → 2CO~2~ + 2C~2~H~5~OH + Energy (ATP)

### Respiratory quotient (R.Q)

Respiratory quotient is the ratio of volume of carbon dioxide liberated and the volume of oxygen consumed during respiration. It is expressed as

RQ = Volume of CO~2~ liberated / Volume of O2 consumed

**Points to Remember**

- Tissue is a group of similar or dissimilar cells, having a common orgin and performing similar functions. 

- Plants are capable of synthesizing glucosefrom CO~2~ and H~2~O in the presence of light, by the process of photosynthesis. 

- Light reaction takes place in grana of chloroplast. 

- Dark reaction takes place in stroma of chloroplast. 

- Respiration involves both external and cellular respiration. 

- Aerobic respiration takes place in the presence of oxygen. 

- Aerobic respiration occurs in three major steps like Glycolysis, Krebs cycle and Electron transport chain.
