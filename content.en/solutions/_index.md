**INTRODUCTION**

You have learnt about mixtures in your lower classes. Most of the substances that we encounter in our daily life are mixtures of two or more substances. The substances present in a mixture may exist in one or more physical state. For example, when we burn wood, the smoke released is a mixture of solid carbon and gases like CO2, CO, etc.

In some cases of mixtures, their components can be separated easily whereas in some other cases they cannot be. Consider the two mixtures, one which contains salt and water, and the another which contains sand and water. Water is the one of the components in both the mixtures. In the first case salt disolves in water. In the second case the sand does not disolve in water. Sand in water can be separated by filtration but salt cannot be separated as it dissolves in water to form a homogeneous

mixture. This kind of homogenous mixtures are termed as “**solutions**”.

125 **Solutions**

All the life forms on the earth are associated with solutions. Plants take solutions of nutrients for their growth from the soil. Most of the liquids found in human body including blood, lymph and urine are solutions. Day to day human activities like washing, cooking, cleaning and few other activities involve the formation of solutions with water. Similarly, the drinks what we take, like fruit juice, aerated drinks, tea, coffee etc. are also solutions. Therefore, the ability of water to form solutions is responsible for sustenance of life.

## COMPONENTS OF SOLUTIONS


We know that, a **solution is a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances**. In a solution, the component which is present in lesser amount (by weight), is called **solute** and the component, which is present in a larger amount (by weight) is called solvent. The solute gets distributed uniformly throughout the solvent and thus forming the mixture homogeneous. So, the solvent acts as a dissolving medium in a solution. The process of uniform distribution of solute into solvent is called **dissolution**. Figure 9.2 shows the schematic representation of solution.

Solute Solvent Solution

**Figure 9.2** Formation of solution

**Conceptual**

**Thoughts**

**All solutions are mixtures; but all mixtures are not solutions.**

**why?**

A solution must at least be consisting of two components (a solute and a solvent). Such solutions which are made of one solute and one solvent (two components) are called **binary solutions**. e.g. On adding copper sulphate crystals to water, it dissolves in water forming a solution of copper sulphate as shown in Figure 9.3. It contains two components i.e. one solute- copper sulphate and one solvent-water. So it is a binary solution. Similarly, a solution may contain more than two components. For example if salt and sugar are added to water, both dissolve in water forming a solution. Here two solutes are dissolved in one solvent. Such kind of solutions which contain three components are called **ternary solutions**.

**Figure 9.3** Formation of Copper sulphate solution

## Types of Solutions


### Based on the physical state of the solute and the solvent


We know that substances normally exist in three physical states (phases) i.e., solid, liquid and gas. In binary solutions, both the solvent and solute may exist in any of these physical states. But the solvent constitutes the major part of the solution. Its physical state is the primary factor which determine the characteristics of the solution. Therefore, there are different types of binary solutions as listed in Table 9.1.

### Based on the type of solvent


Most of the substances are soluble in water. That is why, water is called as ‘Universal solvent”. However some substances do not dissolve in water. Therefore, other solvents such as ethers, benzene, alcohols etc., are used to prepare a solution. On the basis of type of solvent, solutions are classified into two types. They are aqueous solutions and non-aqueous solutions.

**a) Aqueous solution:**

The solution in which water acts as a solvent is called aqueous solution. E.g. Common salt in water, Sugar in water, Copper sulphate in water etc.

**b) Non – Aqueous solution:**

The solution in which any liquid, other than water, acts as a solvent is called non- aqueous solution. Solvent other than water is referred to as non-aqueous solvent. Generally, alcohols, benzene, ethers, carbon disulphide, acetone, etc., are used as non-aqueous solvents. Examples for non-aqueous solutions: Sulphur dissolved in carbon disulphide, Iodine dissolved in carbon tetrachloride.

**Solute Solvent Example**

b) Sulphur is insoluble in water

### Based on the amount of solute


The amount of the solute that can be dissolved in the given amount of solvent is limited under any given conditions. Based on the amount of solute, in the given amount of solvent, solutions are classified into the following types:

(i) Saturated solution

(ii) Unsaturated solution

(iii) Super saturated solution

**(i)** **Saturated solution:** A solution in which no more solute can be dissolved in a definite amount of the solvent at a given temperature is called saturated solution. e.g. 36 g of sodium chloride in 100 g of water at 25°C forms saturated solution.

and the another is said to be ‘**dilute solution**’. They are schematically represented by Figure 9.5.

Differentiating solutions as dilute and concentrated is a qualitative representation. It does not imply the quantity of the solute. This difference is observed by means of some physical characteristics such as colour, density, etc.

**Activity 1**

Look at the following pictures. Label them as dilute and concentrated solution and justify your answer.

**Tea Copper sulphate**

## Solubility


Usually, there is a limit to the amount of solute that can be dissolved in a given amount of solvent at a given temperature. When this limit is reached, we have a saturated solution and any excess solute that is added, simply settle down at the bottom of the solution. The extent of dissolution of a solute in a solvent can be better explained by its solubility. Solubility is a measure of how much of a solute can be dissolved in a specified amount of a solvent.

Further addition of sodium chloride, leave it undissolved.

**(ii) Unsaturated solution:** Unsaturated solution is one that contains less solute than that of the saturated solution at a given temperature. e.g. 10 g or 20 g or 30 g of Sodium chloride in 100 g of water at 25°C forms an unsaturated solution.

**(iii)** **Super saturated solution:** Supersaturated solution is one that contains more solute than the saturated solution at a given temperature. e.g. 40 g of sodium chloride in 100 g of water at 25°C forms super saturated solution. This state can be achieved by altering any other conditions liken temperature, pressure. Super saturated solutions are unstable, and the solute is reappearing as crystals when the solution is disturbed.

Thoughts

**You are given two samples of**

**solutions of NaCl. Can you identify**

**which one is saturated? and**

**How?**

### Concentrated and dilute solutions


It is another kind of classification of unsaturated solutions. It expresses the relative concentration of two solutions with respect to their solutes present in the given amount of the solvent. For example, you are given two cups of tea. When you taste them, you feel that one is sweeter than the other. What do you infer from it? The tea which sweet more contains higher amount of sugar than the other. How can you express your observation? You can say that the tea is stronger. But a chemist would say that it is ‘concentrated’.

When we compare two solutions having same solute and solvent, the one which contains higher amount of solute per the given amount of solvent is said to be ‘**concentrated solution**’

128**10th Standard Science**

**Solubility is defined as the number of** grams of a solute that can be dissolved in 100 g of a solvent to form its saturated solution at a given temperature and pressure. For example, 36 g of sodium chloride need to be dissolved in 100 g of water to form its saturated solution at 25°C. Thus the solubility of NaCl in water is 36 g at 25°C. The solubility is mathematically expressed as

Solubility = Mass of the solute × 100

**9.4.1  Factors affecting solubility **

There are three main factors which govern the solubility of a solute. They are: (i) Nature of the solute

and solvent (ii) Temperature (iii) Pressure

**(i) Nature of the solute and solvent**

The nature of the solute and solvent plays an important role in solubility. Although water dissolves an enormous variety of substances, both ionic and covalent, it does not dissolve everything. The phrase that scientists often use when predicting solubility is “like dissolves

like.” This expression means that dissolving occurs when similarities exist between the solvent and the solute. For example: Common salt is a polar compound and dissolves readily in polar solvent like water.

Non-polar compounds are soluble in non-polar solvents. For example, Fat dissolved in ether. But non-polar compounds, do not dissolve in polar solvents; polar compounds do not dissolve in non-polar solvents.

**(ii) Effect of Temperature**

**Solubility of Solids in Liquid:** Generally, solubility of a solid solute in

a liquid solvent increases with increase in temperature. For example, a greater amount of sugar will dissolve in warm water than in cold water.

In endothermic process, solubility increases with increase in temperature.

In exothermic process, solubility decreases with increase in temperature. **Solubility of Gases in liquid**

Do you know why is it bubbling when water is boiled? Solubility of gases in liquid decrease with increase in temperature. Generally, water contains dissolved oxygen. When water is heated, the solubility of oxygen in water decreases, so oxygen escapes in the form of bubbles.

Aquatic animals live more in cold regions because, more amount of dissolved oxygen is present in the water of cold regions. This shows that the solubility of oxygen in water is more at low temperatures.

**(iii) Effect of Pressure**

Effect of pressure is observed only in the case of solubility of a gas in a liquid. When the pressure is increased, the solubility of a gas in liquid increases.

The common examples for solubility of gases in liquids are carbonated beverages, i.e. soft drinks, household cleaners containing

aqueous solution of ammonia, formalin- aqueous solution of formaldehyde, etc.

**Figure 9.6 Effect of pressure on solubility**

**More to know**

The effect of pressure on the solubility of a gas in liquid is given by **Henry’s law**. It states that, the solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the pressure of the gas over the solution at a definite temperature.

## Concentration of a Solution


So far, we discussed what is a solution? what does it consist of and its types. Most of the chemical reactions take place in solutions form. So it is essential to quantify the solute in solvent to study the reactions. To quantify the solute in a solution, we can use the term “**concentration**”.

**Concentration of a solution may be defined as the amount of solute present in a given amount of solution or solvent.**

Quantitatively, concentration of a solution may be expressed in different methods. But here, we shall discuss percentage by mass (% mass) and percentage by volume (% volume).

### Mass percentage


Mass percentage of a solution is defined as the percentage by mass of the solute present in the solution. It is mostly used when solute is solid and solvent is liquid.

Mass Percentage

\=

Mass of the solute × 100 Mass of the solution

Mass Percentage

\=

Mass of the solute × 100

Mass of the solute + Mass of the solvent

For example: 5% sugar solution (by mass) means 5 g of sugar in 95 g of water. Hence it is made 100g of solution.

Usually, mass percentage is expressed as w/w (weight / weight); mass percentage is independent of temperature.

### Volume percentage


Volume percentage is defined as the percentage by volume of solute (in ml) present in the given volume of the solution.

Volume Percentage

\=

Volume of the solute × 100 Volume of the solution

Volume Percentage

\=

Volume of the solute × 100

Volume of the solute + volume of the solvent

For example, 10% by volume of the solution of ethanol in water, means 10 ml of ethanol in 100 ml of solution (or 90 ml of water)

Usually volume percentage is expressed as v/v (volume / volume). It is used when both the solute and solvent are liquids. Volume percentage decreases with increases in temperature, because of expansion of liquid.

You can notice that in the commercial products that we come across in our daily life such as a solution of syrups, mouth wash, antiseptic solution, household disinfectants etc., the concentration of the ingredients is expressed as v/v. Similarly, in ointments, antacid, soaps, etc., the concentration of solutions are expressed as w/w.

## Hydrated salts and Water of Crystallization


When ionic substances are dissolved in water to make their saturated aqueous solution, their ions attract water molecules which then attached chemically in certain ratio. This process is called hydration. These ionic substances crystallize out from their saturated aqueous solution with a definite number of molecules of water. The number of water molecules found in the crystalline substance is called **water of crystallization**. Such salts are called hydrated salts.

**Figure 9.8** a) Crystalline hydrated salt b) Amorphous anhydrous salt

On heating these hydrated crystalline salts, they lose their water of crystallization and become amorphous or lose their colour (if they are coloured). Table 9.3 shows some common hydrated salts:

### Copper sulphate pentahydrate CuSO4


**.5H2O (Blue vitriol)**

The number of water molecules in blue vitriol is five. So its water of crystallization is 5. When blue coloured copper sulphate crystals are gently heated, it loses its five water molecules and becomes colourless anhydrous copper sulphate.

If you add few drops of water or allow it to cool, the colourless anhydrous salt again turns back into hydrated salt.

## Hygroscopy


Certain substances, when exposed to the atmospheric air at ordinary temperature, absorb moisture without changing their physical state. Such substances are called **hygroscopic substances** and this property is called hygroscopy.

Hygroscopic substances are used as drying agents.

**Example:** 1. Conc.Sulphuric acid (H2SO4). 2. Phosphorus Pentoxide (P2O5). 3. Quick lime (CaO). 4. Silica gel (SiO2).

## Deliquescence


Certain substances which are so hygroscopic, when exposed to the atmospheric air at ordinary temperatures, absorb enough

water and get completely dissolved. Such substances are called **deliquescent substances** and this property is called **deliquescence**.

Deliquescent substances lose their crystalline shape and ultimately dissolve in the absorbed water forming a saturated solution. Deliquescence is maximum when:

1) The temperature is low 2) The atmosphere is humid **Examples:** Caustic soda (NaOH), Caustic potash (KOH) and Ferric chloride (FeCl3).

**Figure 9.11** Deliquescence in Sodium hydroxide

## Problems Based on Solubility and Percentage by Mass and Volume


**I. Problems based on solubility**

1) 1.5 g of solute is dissolved in 15 g of water to form a saturated solution at 298K. Find out the solubility of the solute at the temperature.

**Table 9.3 Difference between hygroscopic substances and deliquescence.**

**Hygroscopic substances Deliquescence substances**

When exposed to the atmosphere at ordinary temperature, they absorb moisture and do not dissolve.

When exposed to the atmospheric air at ordinary temperature, they absorb moisture and dissolve.

Hygroscopic substances do not change its physical state on exposure to air.

Deliquescent substances change its physical state on exposure to air.

Hygroscopic substances may be amorphous solids or liquids.

Deliquescent substances are crystalline solids.

ii) solid in liquid iii) solid in solid iv) gas in gas

4\. What is aqueous and non-aqueous solution? Give an example.

5\. Define Volume percentage 6. The aquatic animals live more in cold region

Why? 7. Define Hydrated salt. 8. A hot saturated solution of copper sulphate

forms crystals as it cools. Why? 9. Classify the following substances into

deliquescent, hygroscopic. Conc. Sulphuric acid, Copper sulphate penta hydrate, Silica gel, Calcium chloride, and Gypsum salt.

**VI. Long answer:** 1\. Write notes on i) saturated solution

ii) unsaturated solution 2. Write notes on various factors affecting

solubility.

3\. a) What happens when MgSO4 .7H2O is

heated? Write the appropriate equation b) Define solubility 4. In what way hygroscopic substances differ

from deliquescent substances. 5. A solution is prepared by dissolving 45 g of

sugar in 180 g of water. Calculate the mass percentage of solute.

6\. 3.5 litres of ethanol is present in 15 litres of aqueous solution of ethanol. Calculate volume percent of ethanol solution.

**VII. HOTS** 1\. Vinu dissolves 50 g of sugar in 250 ml of hot

water, Sarath dissolves 50 g of same sugar in 250 ml of cold water. Who will get faster dissolution of sugar? and Why?

2\. 'A' is a blue coloured crystaline salt. On heating it loses blue colour and to give 'B'. When water is added, 'B' gives back to 'A'. Identify A and B, write the equation.
