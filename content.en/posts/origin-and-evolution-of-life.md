2. The degenerated and non-functional organs found in an organism are called ______________
3. The forelimbs of bat and human are examples of ______________
4. The theory of natural selection for evolution was proposed by ______________

## III. State true or false. Correct the false statements

1. The use and disuse theory of organs' was postulated by Charles Darwin.
2. The homologous organs look similar and perform similar functions but they have different origin and developmental pattern.
3. Birds have evolved from ______________

## IV. Match the following

| Column A | Column B |
|----------|----------|
| a) Atavism | caudal vertebrae and vermiform appendix |
| b) Vestigial organs | a forelimb of a cat and a bat's wing |
| c) Analogous organs | rudimentary tail and thick hair on the body |
| d) Homologous organs | a wing of a bat and a wing of an insect |
| e) Wood park | radiocarbon dating |
| f) W.F. Libby | Thiruvakkarai |

## V. Answer in a word or sentence

1. A human hand, a front leg of a cat, a front flipper of a whale and a bat's wing look dissimilar and adapted for different functions. What is the name given to these organs?
2. Which organism is considered to be the fossil bird?
3. What is the study of fossils called?

## VI. Short answers questions

1. The degenerated wing of a kiwi is an acquired character. Why is it an acquired character?
2. Why is Archaeopteryx considered to be a connecting link?

2. How do you differentiate homologous organs from analogous organs?
3. How does fossilization occur in plants?

## IX. Higher Order Thinking Skills (HOTS)

1. Arun was playing in the garden. Suddenly he saw a dragon fly sitting on a plant. He observed the wings of it. He thought it looked similar to a wing of a crow. Is he correct? Give reason for your answer.
2. Imprints of fossils tell us about evolution - How?
3. Octopus, cockroach and frog all have eyes. Can we group these animals together to establish a common evolutionary origin. Justify your answer.
