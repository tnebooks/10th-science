   - c) Euploidy
   - d) polyploidy

### II. Fill in the blanks

1. The pairs of contrasting character (traits) of Mendel are called ________
2. Physical expression of a gene is called ________
3. The thin thread like structures found in the nucleus of each cell are called ________
4. DNA consists of two ________ chains
5. An inheritable change in the amount or the structure of a gene or a chromosome is called ________

### III. Identify whether the statement are True or False. Correct the false statement

1. A typical Mendelian dihybrid ratio of {{< katex >}}F_{2}{{< /katex >}} generation is 3:1.
2. A recessive factor is altered by the presence of a dominant factor.
3. Each gamete has only one allele of a gene.
4. Hybrid is an offspring from a cross between genetically different parent.
5. Some of the chromosomes have an elongated knob-like appendages known as telomere.
6. New nucleotides are added and new complementary strand of DNA is formed with the help of enzyme DNA polymerase.
7. Down's syndrome is the genetic condition with 45 chromosomes.

### IV. Match the following

| | |
|:---|:---|
| 1. Autosomes | Trisomy 21 |
| 2. Diploid condition | 9:3:3:1 |
| 3. Allosome | 22 pair of chromosome |
| 4. Down's syndrome | 2n |
| 5. Dihybrid ratio | 23rd pair of chromosome |

### V. Answer in a sentence

1. What is a cross in which inheritance of two pairs of contrasting characters are studied?
2. Name the conditions when both the alleles are identical?
3. A garden pea plant produces axial white flowers. Another of the same species produced terminal violet flowers. Identify the dominant trait?
4. What is the name given to the segments of DNA, which are responsible for the inheritance of a particular character?
5. Name the bond which binds the nucleotides in a DNA.

### VI. Short answers questions

1. Why did Mendel select pea plant for his experiments?
2. What do you understand by the term phenotype and genotype?
3. What are allosomes?
4. What are Okazaki fragments?
5. Why is euploidy considered to be advantageous to both plants and animals?
6. A pure tall plant (TT) is crossed with pure dwarf plant (tt), what would be the {{< katex >}}F_{1}{{< /katex >}} and {{< katex >}}F_{2}{{< /katex >}} generations? Explain.
7. Explain the structure of a chromosome.
8. Label the parts of the DNA in the diagram given below. Explain the structure briefly.

### VII. Long answer questions

1. Explain with an example the inheritance of dihybrid cross. How is it different from monohybrid cross?
2. How is the structure of DNA organised? What is the biological significance of DNA?
3. The sex of the new born child is a matter of chance and neither of the parents may be considered responsible for it. What would be the possible fusion of gametes to determine the sex of the child?

### VIII. Higher Order Thinking Skills (HOTS)

1. Flowers of the garden pea are bisexual and self-pollinated. Therefore, it is difficult to perform hybridization experiment by crossing a particular pistil with the specific pollen grains. How Mendel made it possible in his monohybrid and dihybrid crosses?
2. Pure-bred tall pea plants are first crossed with pure-bred dwarf pea plants. The pea plants obtained in {{< katex >}}F_{1}{{< /katex >}} generation are then selfed to produce {{< katex >}}F_{2}{{< /katex >}} generation of pea plants.
   - a. What do the plants of {{< katex >}}F_{1}{{< /katex >}} generation look like?
   - b. What is the ratio of tall plants to dwarf plants in {{< katex >}}F_{2}{{< /katex >}} generation?
   - c. Which type of plants were missing in {{< katex >}}F_{1}{{< /katex >}} generation but reappeared in {{< katex >}}F_{2}{{< /katex >}} generation?
3. Kavitha gave birth to a female baby. Her family members say that she can give birth to only female babies because of her family history. Is the statement given by her family members true. Justify your answer.

### IX. Value based question

1. Under which conditions does the law of independent assortment hold good and why?
