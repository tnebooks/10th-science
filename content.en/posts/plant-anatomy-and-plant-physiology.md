2. **Where does the carbon that is used in photosynthesis come from?**
   - Carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

3. **What is the common step in aerobic and anaerobic pathway?**
   - Glycolysis.

4. **Name the phenomenon by which carbohydrates are oxidized to release ethyl alcohol.**
   - Anaerobic respiration / Ethanol fermentation.

## VI. Short answer questions

1. **Give an account on vascular bundle of dicot stem.**
   - Vascular bundles in dicot stem are conjoint, collateral, endarch and open. They are arranged in the form of a ring around the pith. Cambium is present between xylem and phloem, allowing secondary growth.

2. **Write a short note on mesophyll.**
   - Mesophyll is the ground tissue present between upper and lower epidermis of leaf. In dicot leaves, it is differentiated into palisade parenchyma (elongated cells with more chloroplasts below upper epidermis) and spongy parenchyma (spherical/oval cells with intercellular spaces for gaseous exchange).

3. **Draw and label the structure of oxysomes.**
   - Oxysomes are tennis racket shaped particles on inner mitochondrial membrane consisting of:
     - F₁ Head (spherical part)
     - Stalk
     - F₀ Base (embedded in membrane)

4. **Name the three basic tissues system in flowering plants.**
   - (i) Dermal/Epidermal tissue system
   - (ii) Ground tissue system
   - (iii) Vascular tissue system

5. **What is photosynthesis and where in a cell does it occur?**
   - Photosynthesis is the process by which autotrophs convert light energy into chemical energy, synthesizing carbohydrates from CO₂ and water. It occurs in chloroplasts, specifically in the grana (light reaction) and stroma (dark reaction).

6. **What is respiratory quotient?**
   - Respiratory quotient is the ratio of volume of carbon dioxide liberated to the volume of oxygen consumed during respiration (RQ = CO₂ liberated/O₂ consumed).

7. **Why should the light dependent reaction occur before the light independent reaction?**
   - Because light dependent reaction produces ATP and NADPH+H⁺, which are required as energy sources for the light independent reaction (Calvin cycle) to fix CO₂ into carbohydrates.

8. **Write the reaction for photosynthesis?**
   - 6CO₂ + 12H₂O → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂↑ + 6H₂O

## VII. Long answer questions

1. **Differentiate the following:**
   
   **a) Monocot root and Dicot root**
   
   | Feature | Dicot Root | Monocot Root |
   |:---|:---|:---|
   | Number of Xylem | Tetrarch (4) | Polyarch (many) |
   | Cambium | Present (secondary growth) | Absent |
   | Secondary Growth | Present | Absent |
   | Pith | Absent or small | Large and prominent |
   | Conjunctive Tissue | Parenchyma | Sclerenchyma |
   
   **b) Aerobic and Anaerobic respiration**
   
   | Feature | Aerobic Respiration | Anaerobic Respiration |
   |:---|:---|:---|
   | Oxygen requirement | Required | Not required |
   | End products | CO₂, H₂O, ATP | Ethanol or Lactic acid, CO₂, less ATP |
   | Amount of ATP | 36-38 ATP | 2 ATP |
   | Location | Cytoplasm and Mitochondria | Cytoplasm only |
   | Complete oxidation | Yes | No |

2. **Describe and name three stages of cellular respiration that aerobic organisms use to obtain energy from glucose.**
   
   **a) Glycolysis**: Occurs in cytoplasm. One glucose (6C) breaks into two pyruvic acid (3C) molecules. Net gain of 2 ATP and 2 NADH.
   
   **b) Krebs Cycle (TCA)**: Occurs in mitochondrial matrix. Pyruvic acid is oxidized to CO₂ and water. Produces 2 ATP, 6 NADH, and 2 FADH₂ per glucose.
   
   **c) Electron Transport Chain**: Occurs in inner mitochondrial membrane. NADH and FADH₂ donate electrons. Oxidative phosphorylation produces ~34 ATP. O₂ is final electron acceptor forming water.

3. **How does the light dependent reaction differ from the light independent reaction? What are the end product and reactants in each? Where does each reaction occur within the chloroplast?**

   | Feature | Light Dependent Reaction | Light Independent Reaction |
   |:---|:---|:---|
   | **Location** | Thylakoid membranes (Grana) | Stroma |
   | **Light requirement** | Required | Not required |
   | **Reactants** | H₂O, ADP, NADP⁺, light | CO₂, ATP, NADPH+H⁺ |
   | **Products** | ATP, NADPH+H⁺, O₂ | Glucose, ADP, NADP⁺ |
   | **Also called** | Hill reaction | Calvin cycle/Dark reaction |

## VIII. Higher Order Thinking Skills (HOTS)

1. **The reactions of photosynthesis make up a biochemical pathway.**
   
   **A) What are the end product of light and dark reaction of photosynthesis?**
   - Light reaction: ATP, NADPH+H⁺, and O₂
   - Dark reaction: Glucose (carbohydrates)
   
   **B) Explain how the biochemical pathway of photosynthesis recycles many of its own reactions and identify the recycled reactants.**
   - The ADP and NADP⁺ produced in the Calvin cycle (dark reaction) are recycled back to the light reaction where they are re-energized to form ATP and NADPH+H⁺. This creates a continuous cycle where the products of light reaction become reactants for dark reaction and vice versa.

2. **Where do the light dependent reaction and the Calvin cycle occur in the chloroplast?**
   - Light dependent reaction: Thylakoid membranes (Grana)
   - Calvin cycle (Light independent reaction): Stroma

# Points to Remember

- Tissue is a group of similar or dissimilar cells, having a common origin and performing similar functions.
- Plants are capable of synthesizing glucose from CO₂ and H₂O in the presence of light, by the process of photosynthesis.
- Light reaction takes place in grana of chloroplast.
- Dark reaction takes place in stroma of chloroplast.
- Respiration involves both external and cellular respiration.
- Aerobic respiration takes place in the presence of oxygen.
- Aerobic respiration occurs in three major steps like Glycolysis, Krebs cycle and Electron transport chain.
