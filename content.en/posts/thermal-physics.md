3. One calorie is the amount of heat energy required to raise the temperature of **1 gram** of water through **1°C**.
4. According to Boyle's law, the shape of the graph between pressure and reciprocal of volume is **a straight line**

### III. State whether the following statements are true or false, if false explain why?

1. For a given heat in liquid, the apparent expansion is more than that of real expansion.
   - **False** - Real expansion is always more than apparent expansion.

2. Thermal energy always flows from a system at higher temperature to a system at lower temperature.
   - **True**

3. According to Charles's law, at constant pressure, the temperature is inversely proportional to volume.
   - **False** - According to Charles's law, volume is directly proportional to temperature at constant pressure.

### IV. Match the items in column-I to the items in column-II

| Column-I | Column-II |
|:---|:---|
| 1. Linear expansion | (d) change in length |
| 2. Superficial expansion | (e) change in area |
| 3. Cubical expansion | (a) change in volume |
| 4. Heat transformation | (b) hot body to cold body |
| 5. Boltzmann constant | (c) 1.381 × 10⁻²³ JK⁻¹ |

### V. Assertion and reason type questions

**a.** Both the assertion and the reason are true and the reason is the correct explanation of the assertion

**b.** Both the assertion and the reason are true but the reason is not the correct explanation of the assertion

**c.** Assertion is true but the reason is false

**d.** Assertion is false but the reason is true

1. **Assertion:** If one end of the rod is heated, other end also is heated.
   **Reason:** Heat always flows from a region of lower temperature to higher temperature of the body.
   - **Answer: (c)** - Assertion is true but the reason is false. (Heat flows from higher to lower temperature)

2. **Assertion:** Gas is highly compressible than solid and liquid
   **Reason:** Interatomic or intermolecular distance in the gas is comparably high.
   - **Answer: (a)** - Both true and reason correctly explains the assertion.

### VI. Answer in briefly

1. **Define one calorie.**
   - One calorie is defined as the amount of heat energy required to rise the temperature of 1 gram of water through 1°C.

2. **Distinguish between linear, arial or superficial and cubical expansion.**

3. **What is co-efficient of cubical expansion?**
   - The ratio of increase in volume of the body per degree rise in temperature to its unit volume is called as coefficient of cubical expansion.

4. **State Boyle's law**
   - When the temperature of a gas is kept constant, the volume of a fixed mass of gas is inversely proportional to its pressure. (PV = constant)

5. **State the law of volume (Charles's law)**
   - When the pressure of gas is kept constant, the volume of a gas is directly proportional to the temperature of the gas. (V/T = constant)

6. **Distinguish between ideal gas and real gas.**

7. **What is co-efficient of real expansion?**
   - Coefficient of real expansion is defined as the ratio of the true rise in the volume of the liquid per degree rise in temperature to its unit volume.

8. **What is co-efficient of apparent expansion?**
   - Coefficient of apparent expansion is defined as the ratio of the apparent rise in the volume of the liquid per degree rise in temperature to its unit volume.

### VII. Numerical problems

1. **Find the final temperature of a copper rod. Whose area of cross section changes from 10 m² to 11 m² due to heating. The copper rod is initially kept at 90 K. (Coefficient of superficial expansion is 0.0021/K)**

2. **Calculate the coefficient of cubical expansion of a zinc bar. Whose volume is increased 0.25 m³ from 0.3 m³ due to the change in its temperature of 50**

### VIII. Answer in detail

1. **Derive the ideal gas equation.**

2. **Explain the experiment of measuring the real and apparent expansion of a liquid with a neat diagram.**

### IX. HOT question

**If you keep ice at 0°C and water at 0°C in either of your hands, in which hand you will feel more chillness? Why?**
