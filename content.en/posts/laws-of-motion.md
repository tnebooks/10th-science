### V. Assertion & Reasoning

Mark the correct choice as

- (a) If both the assertion and the reason are true and the reason is the correct explanation of assertion.
- (b) If both the assertion and the reason are true, but the reason is not the correct explanation of the assertion.
- (c) Assertion is true, but the reason is false.
- (d) Assertion is false, but the reason is true.

1. **Assertion:** The sum of the clockwise moments is equal to the sum of the anticlockwise moments.
   **Reason:** The principle of conservation of momentum is valid if the external force on the system is zero.

2. **Assertion:** The value of 'g' decreases as height and depth increases from the surface of the Earth.
   **Reason:** 'g' depends on the mass of the object and the Earth.
