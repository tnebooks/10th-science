## Points to Remember

- Many bacteria and protozoa simply divide into two or more daughter cells by fission.
- Organisms such as hydra can regenerate if they are broken into pieces. They can also give out buds which mature into new individuals.
- Reproduction in flowering plants involves transfer of pollen grains from the anther to the stigma which is referred to as pollination. This is followed by fertilization.
- Sexual reproduction involves the fusion of two haploid gametes (male and the female gametes) to form a diploid individual (zygote).
- The formation of the sperm in male and the ovum in female is called gametogenesis. It involves spermatogenesis (formation of spermatozoa) and oogenesis (the formation of ova).
- The cyclic events that take place in a rhythmic manner during the reproductive period of a woman's life is called menstrual cycle.
- The process of attachment of the blastocyst to the uterine wall (endometrium) is called implantation.
- The placenta is a temporary association between the developing embryo and maternal tissues.
- Parturition is the expulsion of young one from the mother's uterus.
- Contraception is one of the best birth control measures. The devices used for contraception are called contraceptive devices.
