### V. Understand the assertion statement, justify the reason given and choose the correct choice

a. Assertion is correct and reason is wrong
b. Reason is correct and the assertion is wrong
c. Both assertion and reason is correct
d. Both assertion and reason is wrong.

1. **Assertion:** Hybrid is superior than either of its parents.
   **Reason:** Hybrid vigour is lost upon inbreeding.

2. **Assertion:** Colchicine reduces the chromosome number.
