## III. Identify whether the statements are True or False. Correct the false statement

1. An anticoagulant present in saliva of leech is called **hirudin**. (True)
2. The vas deferens serves to transport the **sperms**. (True)
3. Diastema is a gap between premolar and molar teeth in **rabbit**. (False - *It is a gap between incisors and premolars*)
4. The cerebral hemispheres of rabbit are connected by band of nerve tissue called **corpus callosum**. (True)

## IV. Match columns I, II and III correctly

| Organs | Membranous Covering | Location |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Brain | **meninges** | **cranial cavity** |
| Kidney | **capsule** | **abdominal cavity** |
| Heart | **pericardium** | **enclosed in thoracic cavity** |
| Lungs | **pleura** | **mediastinum** |

## V. Answer in a sentence

1. **Give the common name of the Hirudinaria granulosa.**
   - Indian Cattle Leech.

2. **How does leech respire?**
   - Through the skin (cutaneous respiration).

3. **Write the dental formula of rabbit.**
   - 2033/1023 or I²/₁, C⁰/₀, PM³/₂, M³/₃ / I¹/₁, C⁰/₀, PM²/₁, M³/₃

4. **How many pairs of testes are present in leech?**
   - Eleven pairs (11 pairs).

5. **How is diastema formed in rabbit?**
   - Due to the absence of canines, creating a gap between incisors and premolars.

6. **What organs are attached to the two bronchi?**
   - Lungs.

7. **Which organ acts as suction pump in leech?**
   - Pharynx.

8. **What does CNS stand for?**
   - Central Nervous System.

9. **Why is the teeth of rabbit called heterodont?**
   - Because the teeth are of different types (incisors, premolars, and molars).

10. **How does leech suck blood from the host?**
    - By making a Y-shaped incision with its jaws and sucking blood through the pharynx.

## VI. Short answer questions

1. **Why are the rings of cartilages found in trachea of rabbit?**
   - The rings of cartilage help in the free passage of air and prevent the collapse of the trachea during breathing.

2. **List out the parasitic adaptations in leech.**
   - Two suckers for attachment to host
   - Three jaws for making Y-shaped wound
   - Hirudin secretion to prevent blood clotting
   - Anaesthetic substance to prevent host from feeling the bite
   - Absence of parapodia and setae
   - Blood storage in crop for several months
   - Reduced digestive secretions

## VII. Long answer questions

1. **How is the circulatory system designed in leech to compensate the heart structure?**
   - Leech has no true heart. Instead, it has four longitudinal haemocoelic channels (canals) filled with blood-like fluid. Two lateral channels serve as hearts with inner valves. These channels are connected posteriorly in the 26th segment. This haemocoelic system compensates for the absence of a true heart and blood vessels.

2. **How does locomotion take place in leech?**
   - **Looping/Crawling movement:** By contraction and relaxation of muscles using two suckers for attachment.
   - **Swimming movement:** By performing undulating movements in water.

3. **Explain the male reproductive system of rabbit with a labelled diagram.**
   - The male reproductive system consists of:
     - A pair of ovoid testes enclosed in scrotal sacs
     - Seminiferous tubules in each testis
     - Epididymis (coiled tubule) for sperm storage
     - Vas deferens (sperm duct)
     - Urethra running through the penis
     - Three accessory glands: prostate gland, cowper's gland, and perineal gland
     - Their secretions help in reproduction

## VIII. Higher Order Thinking Skills (HOTS)

1. **Arjun is studying in tenth standard. He was down with fever and went to meet the doctor. As he went to the clinic he saw a patient undergoing treatment for severe leech bite. Being curious, Arjun asked the doctor why leech bite was not felt as soon as it attaches to the skin? What would have been the reply given by the doctor?**
   - The doctor would explain that leeches inject an anaesthetic substance through their saliva that numbs the area, preventing the host from feeling the bite immediately.

2. **Shylesh has some pet animals at his home. He has few rabbits too, one day while feeding them he observed something different with the teeth. He asked his grandfather, why is it so? What would have been the explanation of his grandfather?**
   - The grandfather would explain that rabbits have heterodont dentition with different types of teeth. They have diphyodont dentition (two sets of teeth). Importantly, canines are absent, creating a diastema (gap) between incisors and premolars. This adaptation helps in grinding and chewing plant material efficiently.

## IX. Value based questions

1. **Leeches do not have an elaborate secretion of digestive juices and enzymes - Why?**
   - Because leeches store blood in their crop chambers, which can nourish them for several months. Since they feed infrequently on blood (a protein-rich food), they do not need elaborate digestive secretions.

2. **How is the digestive system of rabbit suited for herbivorous mode of feeding?**
   - The digestive system is adapted for herbivorous feeding through:
     - Chisel-like incisors for cutting grass
     - Diastema for manipulation of food
     - Well-developed caecum containing bacteria for cellulose digestion
     - Complex stomach and long intestine for thorough digestion of plant material
